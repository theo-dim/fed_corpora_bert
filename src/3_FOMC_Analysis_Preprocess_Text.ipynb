Scott, you mentioned the possibility that some\rparties may be suffering major losses by reason of the decline in the\rprice of gold.

Do you see continuing strong pressure for the\rdollar to go up in the face of that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. No, one of the reasons we repaid our debt so\rquickly was that there is the risk of a snapback. As I say, the only\rthing that is supporting us at the moment is really the interest rate\rdifferential.

But if the dollar goes up,\rsay, three pfennigs in one day, wouldn't it be better to absorb some\rof that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. Well, the rise of the dollar has been almost\rtotally during the European hours, and the Bundesbank has been\rin one\rprepared to\roperation or the other. By the time we come in, the market is pretty\rlimp. We have been able to do small amounts. We haven't wanted to do\rtoo much for fear that the market psychology would turn against us\rsaying:\r\"Aha, the United States is trying to drive the dollar down\rSo it's a very, very delicate question. On the other hand,\ragain.\"\rthe Bundesbank has had some of the same problems with the mark that we\rhad back last fall when the dollar was going down and we were having\rtrouble stopping the slide, even though we were intervening in big\ramounts.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. The market moves against the intervention is\rwhat you are saying. The dollar goes up in Frankfurt against the\rBundesbank intervention and doesn't go up in New York despite the\rabsence of intervention.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. We have been prepared to operate a little, but\r[the dollar] has been pretty steady in New York.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We need to ratify the transactions since\rSecond?\rthe last meeting. Do we have a motion?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","SEVERAL.\r\rSecond.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\rrecommendation?\r\r[Approved]\r\rwithout objection.\r\rYou have a\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. For once I don't have to recommend any swap\rrenewals. But I do have a rather complicated transaction to describe,\rso that I can be authorized to complete it. When the dollar came into\rdemand in late February, early March, the Bundesbank supplemented its\rspot sales of dollars with forward sales of dollars against marks for\rdelivery in early May. The choice of dates was related to the\r\r\f3/18/80\r\rdomestic liquidity situation in Germany. Mark liquidity was expected\rto be more ample in early May than in early March, so the forward\rsales of the dollar would help mop up some of that excess liquidity.\rSince the Bundesbank\requivalent of marks.\rThe total was\rwas sharing half of the mark proceeds of its spot sales of dollars\rwith us at the time, and we had no idea how long the dollar would\rremain in demand, we asked them if they might also share the proceeds\rof the forward sales. It took them several days to come back with an\ranswer; and when they did, they set some conditions that required\rconsultations on our side within the Federal Reserve and with the\rIn the meantime the dollar continued to rise and the System\rTreasury.\rIn view of the\rcontinued to make good progress in repaying swap debt.\rTreasury's need for marks to cover the Carter notes, we finally\ragreed. In response, the Bundesbank raised no objection. But after\rfurther review on their part, they insisted that the Federal Reserve\ras the central bank of the United States be the direct counterparty on\rthe forward contracts rather than the U.S. Treasury.\rSubject to your approval, the solution we have worked out is\rone\rthat the System would enter into two sets of forward contracts:\rwith the Bundesbank to obtain the marks directly from it, so that as\rthe central bank of the United States we are sharing in that\roperation; and the other between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury\rto pass the marks directly on to the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\rThese transactions would be at the same rates, so there is neither\rprofit nor loss to the System. The reason I am laying this out to you\ris that the Bundesbank\r\rAs Manager, it is\rdifficult for me to argue that these transactions would be\rExceptions have to\rbe expressly authorized by the Committee. Consequently, I am\rrequesting authority from the Committee to make an explicit exception\rThe Treasury needs the\rto the rule so that we can complete the deal.\rSince some of the Treasury's mark debt is at\runder the Carter notes.\reven higher mark rates than those on these contracts, the cost\rcomparisons are not excessively unfavorable to the Treasury.\rMoreover, should the System need to incur additional swap debt before\rfrom us so that we could use the marks in repayment. The transactions\rare quite complicated but essentially mean that the U.S. authorities\rworth of marks to work with\rwill gain an additional\rshould the occasion arise.

So we\rcould have a surge in borrowing, which is not really a reserve\rbalancing decision but just a portfolio balancing decision on the part\rof those institutions, that we would need to adjust for in our\rnonborrowed [path].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is no question that if new borrowers\rcome in for emergency reasons or because they are new, we will have to\rmake an adjustment to allow for that.

I think it's a\rmajor hazard to introduce something that is going to be as difficult\ras this for the banks to handle on top of all this other stuff that we\rhave been giving them.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. My only point was that if the Board and the\rCommittee wanted to do away with lagged reserve accounting, the time\rto do away with it is when the whole new reserve system goes into\reffect, [when it is] applicable to other institutions.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rI understand that consideration.\r\rMr.\r\rRoos.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

STERNLIGHT.\rI would say that what we have in mind from\rday to day is more of a nonborrowed objective. Although as I\rdescribed, in certain circumstances, such as when we get a bulge of\rborrowing over the weekend that may have been caused by banks\ranticipating a discount rate action, it seems sensible to come in\rbelow, let's say, a nonborrowed interim objective.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

If we don't provide the reserves in\rnonborrowed form, they will have to get the reserves either through\rborrowings or be deficient in their reserves.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

ROOS.\r\rAre we fearful that interest rates will\r\r[rise]?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. The Committee has set bounds on the funds\rrate.\rIf total reserves were the overriding objective, bar nothing,\rthen we could drive interest rates up to just about any point, I would\rthink.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And even then we can't affect total\rreserves.\rThe banks are just going to borrow. What we can affect is\rhow much they borrow in any particular week.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH.

The important point really is the one you made a\rwhile ago, Chuck, about the need for reassessing the nonborrowed\rreserve target more frequently. I was on the call and I sensed that\rwe really ought to be doing that; we did speed it up last month, but I\rwould like to see even more.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Balles.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BALLES.\r[Unintelligible] keep the level of borrowed\rAnd to the surprise\rreserves at about what we would hope to have it.\rof most, if not all of us, the necessity of frequent adjustments just\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-11-\r\rdidn't come along for a long time. It looks as if perhaps February\rmight have been the month when it could have been used. The question,\ras you look back in a little post-mortem, Peter, is whether it would\rhave made any difference. Would it have helped the cause, so to\rspeak, in preventing total reserves from getting too big, if we had\rdone what we thought we would have to do on that October 6 game plan,\rwhich is to put the discount rate up?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, of course, the discount rate was moved\rin the middle of February along with the Desk taking measures to\rimpose greater reserve restraint. There was a certain amount of\rpressure that emerged almost automatically out of the process just by\rour sticking to our nonborrowed path when the banks were demanding\radditional reserves. That automatically imposed some increased need\rfor borrowing. And then a further downward adjustment was made in the\rnonborrowed path to increase the degree of pressure, and at about the\rsame time the discount rate was raised. So by forcing the banks to\rborrow--I think it was around $1.8 billion--at an even higher discount\rrate, we put still greater upward pressure [on rates].\rWhat we got,\ras I described, was a very substantial move in short-term rates of 3\ror 4 percentage points over a few weeks. And I think it got some\rbanks feeling that they were staring very hard at the possibility of a\rcrunch and the prospect of just not being able to fund themselves. So\rin that sense the program is working; it has [produced] very real\rrestraint for the banking system. I don't know that bigger moves or\rearlier moves in the discount rate would have done anything more than\rwas being done [through our operations].\rI don't know that we should\rhave [done] more because I think we were imposing quite a bit of\rrestraint.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BALLES. One other question, Mr. Chairman. I would like\rto ask Steve something in this case, in conjunction with the Bluebook\ralternatives. Steve, would it be reasonable or even feasible for the\rstaff to attempt to estimate a level of the discount rate that would\rbe consistent with the money growth targets?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, I share much of what Mr. Sternlight says.\rIf you want to estimate an interest rate that would produce these\rresults--I was hoping this method would get away from that a little-it seems to me that, if anything, it would be more like the federal\rfunds rate. In essence, if you look over a long enough time period,\rit doesn't matter very much what part of the total reserves is\rsupplied by nonborrowed reserves and what part is borrowed. What\rreally matters for determining the money supply is the amount of\rreserves, the total base out there to support money in some multiplier\rsense. And over a long enough period, it can't really matter whether\rthat's through nonborrowed reserves or borrowed reserves. In the very\rshort run because of this mix, with required reserves fixed, it does\rmatter because it affects the behavior of the funds rate given the\rdiscount rate. But if we put in a high discount rate, then for any\rgiven total reserves we would have less borrowed reserves and more\rnonborrowed. If our estimate of the discount rate is low, we'd have\rthe reverse situation. So, while we could do that, we would simply be\rchanging the mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves for any\rgiven level of total reserves that would support the money supply. I\rdon't think that would be very helpful to you; we would be glad to do\rit, of course. I think in February the alternatives before the\rCommittee were: making an adjustment in the funds rate fast by\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-12-\r\rraising the discount rate; making it more moderately by gradually\rlowering the nonborrowed path; or making it even more moderately by\rkeeping the nonborrowed path and letting a gentle rise in borrowing\rtake place instead of a rapid rise. What was actually done was to\rhave a small rise in the discount rate and a reduction in the\rnonborrowed path, which was somewhere in between all those\ralternatives.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BALLES. Well, if I could, I'd just raise one more point.\rIn asking my own staff to review what went on during that February\rperiod, it seemed pretty clear to us that the staff here and in New\rYork had done a fine job of guessing what the multiplier was going to\rbe, what the total reserves should be, and what the nonborrowed path\rshould be. There was very fine work on that. Yet the net outcome was\rthat total reserves got out of hand on the up side for a while. What\rI am trying to get to the bottom of, with the benefit of hindsight, is\rhow you and Peter now think that could be headed off in the future.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, our views are probably marginally\rdifferent. A difference is that I might allege that we could hit the\rtotal reserve path week to week. I don't think it's very important to\rdo it, but we could without lagged reserve accounting. But we'd have\rto have very large movements in the federal funds rate because we'd\rhave to force the banks, within the statement week, to adjust their\rdeposits to the total reserves we'd put out there. We'd have to force\rthem to do it. Without lagged reserve accounting that is possible.\rWith lagged reserve accounting, that could also occur. If we allow\renough pressure on the funds rate, they could make the adjustments in\rdeposits but we just won't see it in total reserves until two weeks\rlater. So within a very short-run period it would look as if we were\rmissing our total reserves; but actually we'd be getting adjustments\rin deposits that would be [evident] in required reserves two weeks\rlater and we'd really not be off very badly. We would just be over\rpath for a while and then we'd be back on path. That's the essence of\rwhat Mr. Sternlight is saying and I wouldn't quarrel with that\rparticular statement. Indeed, the money supply is coming back on\rtarget now, or seemingly so, if March turns out as we are projecting\rit. There has been a rapid response to the rise in the funds rate\rthat has occurred, just as happened in October, which may be a\rcoincidence or it may be that the lags [in response to changes in] the\rfunds rate are not six months [but are closer to] one day. It's hard\rto believe the latter but something like that has happened for two\rsuccessive periods. I am not sure whether I have answered the\rquestion, but I think I at least came close to it.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. MORRIS. May I ask Steve a question? The advocates of\rcontemporaneous reserve accounting argue that there would be less\rvolatility in the funds rate than under lagged accounting. Do you\rsubscribe to that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Oh no, I think there would be quite a bit more,\rfor one reason. The one [internal] reason is that Mr. Sternlight\rreally won't be \"able\"--and I put the word in quotes because I don't\rmean that he's really managing the funds rate--to adapt his operations\ras readily because in the current week he won't know required\rreserves. [Suppose] this week we're going to provide $100 in total\rreserves. Given the fluctuations in deposits that occur from week to\rweek, we really won't know whether the required reserves in the week\r\r\f-13-\r\r3/18/80\r\rIf they\rrelative to the $100 in total reserves would be $20 or $90.\rturn out to be $20, Mr. Sternlight is going to find that as he puts in\rnonborrowed reserves, there are going to be huge declines in borrowing\rand huge declines in the federal funds rate. And he's not going to\rhave any alternative but to chase those borrowings down and put in\rmore nonborrowed. Because of the volatility of deposits week to week,\rI think we'd be certain to get more fluctuations in the federal funds\rrate. However, with the system we're now operating on, where he knows\rrequired reserves and we make adjustments on an average path for a\rfour-week period, we make those adjustments so that we [take into\raccount] the required reserve pattern that we know for certain over\rthe two weeks ahead. And we tend to make the borrowings the same in\reach of those weeks.\rSo we let nonborrowed reserves vary with the\rdeposits while tending to hold the borrowing stable in an average path\rI know that sounds like gobbledygook, but it\rfor a four-week period.\ris what we do.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Wallich.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. I wonder if I may ask two questions? The first\rone is to Steve. Steve, on contemporaneous reserve accounting, how\rmuch of a change in deposits would you need in order to sweat out $1\rof reserve deficiency?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD.\rGovernor Wallich.\r\rI am not sure I get the gist of your question,\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rIt depends on what the multiplier is.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. The multiplier on demand deposits at the moment\ris roughly 6. So if we took put in $1 of reserves, we ought to get $6\rmore, roughly, in demand deposits. But that is not certain; if we put\rin reserves, they may end up in currency or anywhere else for that\rmatter. But that's the multiplier on demand deposits; it's a lot\rhigher on time deposits.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. The point I am trying to get at is:\rIsn't the\radditional adjustment you get from contemporaneous reserve accounting\rrelatively small? You need a very large movement in deposits in order\rto overcome a small deficiency or surplus of reserves.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Contemporaneous reserve accounting, as nearly\ras I can tell, does only two things for you. First, it absolutely can\rremove interest rates in some sense from your consideration. If you\rbelieved that there was a multiplier that the staff could predict, you\rcould set total reserves; you'd have to chase borrowing up and down\rbut you could come closer to hitting that total reserve target in a\rgiven week. Lord knows what interest rates you'd have, but you might\rhave the money supply. So the interest rates would be forced to\radjust to the reserves. We wouldn't be doing what we do now, which in\rsome sense is to make adjustments in nonborrowed reserves to\rdeliberately force more interest rate pressure on the system. The\rsystem would evolve its own interest rate pressure either up or down\rSo contemporaneous would do that for\ras we put in the total reserves.\ryou; it would remove some little element of prediction we still have\ras to what interest rates we want to see in order to achieve the money\rThat element is left in lagged reserve\rsupply [objectives].\raccounting. The other thing it does, of course, is to speed up the\r\r\f-14-\r\r3/18/80\r\rresponse by 2 weeks. The latter isn't all that important presumably\rbecause 2 weeks out of 52 weeks is not any big deal.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH.\r\rAnd you can anticipate it anyway but--\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. What it really does, in my mind, is to remove\rthe necessity of making judgments about where you want interest rates\rto be.

You mentioned that you\rbought nearly $1/2 billion.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, we were in the midst of a period of\rsizable reserve provision and it was a judgment that we should divide\rup that purchase. We anticipated the need to provide for an outright\rincrease in the portfolio of some $1-1/2 billion. It seemed\rappropriate to do the bulk of it in the bill area, but we had not\rbought any coupon issues for a few months and just in accord with the\rpast dispersion of our buying it seemed appropriate to do some portion\rof it in coupons.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Had we\rraised the discount rate early in March, having in mind that through\rthe period total reserves would be over [path] by about $700 million\rplus, would you not [conclude] that we'd have come closer to the total\rreserve path and that the adjustment would have been a bit quicker? I\rguess the alternate question is: What would you have projected for\rinterest rates?

If you had taken a further upward discount rate\raction from 13 percent, say, to 15 percent, I would have predicted a\rfaster adjustment of\r\rthe money supply only if that rise in the\r\rdiscount rate also meant that you were going to permit the federal\rfunds rate to rise substantially. If you weren't going to permit the\rfederal funds rate to rise substantially, I would assume that that\rupward adjustment in the discount rate would merely have meant that\rtotal reserves would be the same over time but with less borrowing and\rmore nonborrowed. But if you had permitted the funds rate to rise, I\rwould assume banks would have tightened loan terms and maybe sold off\rsome assets, resulting in lower bank credit, lower money growth, less\rrequired reserves and, therefore, less total reserves down the line\rseveral weeks later.\r\rdispatch.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\rMr. Eastburn.\r\rI hope we can proceed here with some\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Let me just say on these questions on\rdiscount rates--I didn't hear the last answer Mr. Axilrod gave--that I\ram not sure it makes a great deal of difference whether we move the\rdiscount rate or not, except for its signalling influence, which might\rhave been considerable. That's because we could adjust the\rborrowings, presumably, to achieve the same result. The reason the\rdiscount rate was not moved--let's be clear about it--is that we were\rwaiting for this program, and it seemed inappropriate to raise the\rdiscount rate when the Administration was trying to negotiate these\rpending changes. The judgment was either right or wrong; but it was a\rjudgment we made.

AXILROD.\r\rMr. Axilrod.\r\r[Statement--see Appendix.]\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In connection with that distinction--the\rwillingness or need of banks to borrow at the discount window--I think\rit is important that we all reiterate publicly or otherwise the fact\rthat this change in the discount rate procedures does not imply any\rgreater willingness on our part to tolerate borrowing. I think your\rdiscount officers ought to make that point to borrowing banks rather\rexplicitly. We don't know how they will react. One can argue it\reither way. But any tendency for them to think that the window is\ropen because the rate, at least the surcharge, is closer to the market\rrate, should be discouraged or we will get a perverse reaction from\rthis action. I think a little more than usual calling to borrowing\rbanks may be justified under the circumstances to point out to them\rrather directly that this is no invitation to borrow.\rLet me just say in connection with setting the stage here\rthat the Chase Manhattan Bank said it is raising its prime rate to 19\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-17-\r\rpercent today. At the same time it is instituting a small business\rbase rate which remains at 18-1/4 percent, effective immediately.\rThey used some language [in their announcement] indicating that they\rthink this is consistent with the philosophy of [the measures]\rannounced by the Federal Reserve. They said they have some special\r[concern] for small businesses and they're acting to ease the strains\rthat small companies face in borrowing money. The special rate\rapplies to companies with assets of $1-1/2 million or below and bank\rloans of $1/2 million or below. With total bank loans of $1/2\rmillion, that implies that a company is borrowing one-third of its\rtotal assets. The bank said the small business rate would apply to\rseveral thousand of its smaller customers.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

We can have a general go-around with\rcomments. But apart from the general business situation, any comments\rthat you have about how far this restraint has gone and how far it\rneeds to go and what the special problems are, as I said, would be\rvery welcome.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. SCHULTZ. May I ask Steve a couple of questions first?\rSteve, I'm a little confused about the relationship between M2 and the\rother aggregates [in the Bluebook alternatives].\rFirst of all let me\rask this question: Is the relationship between the new M2 and GNP\rpretty similar to the relationship between the old M2 and GNP that\rpeople often looked at? I'll get that answer first.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. My memory is that we have ended up with a\rsomewhat better relationship. I had better not answer; my memory is a\rlittle off on that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. SCHULTZ. For the second more important question, let's\rlook at alternative B. The implied rates of growth for February to\rrates for December to June, but the growth rate for M2 has only been\rlowered by 3/4 point from 7-3/4 to 7 percent. Now, given the new\ractions, with the likely impact on money market funds, are we to\r[understand] that you believe there will be strong growth in MMCs and\r2-1/2 year certificates? How do you get that strong-MR. AXILROD. It may turn out that we seriously\runderestimated the growth that would occur in money market funds over\rthe first two months of the year. So there was a much bigger\rexpansion in M2 than the Committee, in effect, wanted at that time.\rWe have assumed that growth in money market funds would drop from here\ron to a rate just slightly above what it was late last year. However,\rthat was without taking into account the latest 15 percent marginal\rreserve requirement on those funds. Taking that into account, we\rwould think that their growth would continue but at a much slower\r\r\f-18-\r\r3/18/80\r\rrate. Using a rule of thumb that Governor Partee introduced to the\rstaff many years ago--and it's been difficult to find a [better] one-I would say that something like 50 percent of that money would go into\rM2 type deposits and another 50 percent would go into large CDs and\rTreasury bills that are not in M2 but are either in M3 or liquid\rassets. I don't think that's too bad a view because roughly 50\rpercent of the liabilities of funds are due to institutions and\ranother 50 percent to individuals. So I would expect that, if\ranything, the 7 percent M2 figure you are referring to may be a shade\rstronger than might develop in light of the program. But I wouldn't\rexpect the difference to be large. That's as far as we've been able\rto go [in our analysis].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I understand these inter-relationships\rcorrectly, the December-to-June figure you show has a monthly base,\rbut if it were on a quarterly base the way the yearly target is, the\rimplied 4th quarter to 2nd quarter figure for M-1A in alternative B,\rfor instance, would be 5-1/4 percent.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

But [the difference] is very substantial, Peter,\rDave, New York's [estimate] is about twice what the-MR. EASTBURN.\r\rYes, there's a very big difference.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. The overall difference is about 8 percentage\rpoints but my impression was that the tax refunds accounted for about\r3 or 4 percentage points of that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EASTBURN. Steve, could you say anything about your\rfeeling of confidence in that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD.\rI was hoping not to. I consider this as\rreasonable an estimate as a group of human beings working together\rmight come to. I didn't give you the specifics, but it assumes\rroughly a $1 billion increase in M1 in the week of the 19th, which is\rthe week we're in, another $2-1/2 billion in the week of the 26th, and\rthen very little increase thereafter. But that gives us a high April\rfigure because from February to the end of March M1 will have\rI\rincreased 12 percent, roughly, and that gets into the April figure.\rwouldn't doubt, given our GNP projections, that we're going to have a\rsecond-quarter rate of growth close to what we've estimated here on\raverage, something like 4-3/4 percent. Whether it's going to come\rwith a large April or a large May or a large June, or whether it will\rbe an even distribution among those months, I really can't be very\rcertain. It would be misleading to say that I feel extremely certain\rabout this; I don't. But I don't think it's unreasonable.\rIt would\rbe what a reasonable set of people would come to at this point.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's fair to say, in the light of\rhistory, that there is no feeling of certainty about any of these\rnumbers.\rIt's my understanding that a refund will feed\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS.\rIs that right?\rdirectly into the money supply.\r\r\f-20-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, there will be checks received by\rconsumers. The uncertainty is what people will do with them. Will\rthey deposit them directly in their savings and time accounts--in\rwhich case it will go into M2--or will they put them in their demand\raccounts? And if they put them in demand accounts, will they hold\rthem for one or two days? In that case it will have some effect on\rM1 but a very small one. That is the reasoning [underlying our\restimate].\rIf people put the funds into demand accounts, we wouldn't\rexpect them to stay there long. Why would people want to hold more\rdemand deposits? So, they would either transfer the funds to another\rasset, such as a money market fund or a T-bill or something, or start\rspending them. In that case, any little upward effect would begin\rcoming down in May and June and July. The only evidence we've really\rhad was on the tax rebate program where checks were sent out to people\ras a tax rebate; those very clearly had a discernable money supply\reffect. On these kinds of refunds, we don't have the experience that\rwould enable us to be very certain about [the effect].\rSo, we are\rwaiting for something to happen; we haven't seen it yet and we may not\rsee it this whole-MS. TEETERS. Well, suppose the refund is real and it occurs.\rIs that enough to knock us off of our money path growth?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, as we said last time and this time also,\rwe think the effect in the three months of March, April, and May might\rbe on the order of 1 to 3 percentage points [unintelligible] and then\runwinding to that extent in June and July and piddling out in August.\rThat's our estimate of what might happen. But we haven't deliberately\rput that in.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a big seasonal in April to take\rcare of this in a normal way?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Yes, but the refunds this year are estimated to\rbe about $12 billion above the average of the last two or three years.\rSo it's more than normal.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rWhat is the normal?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. They are estimating about $46 billion, I think,\rso $33 billion or so must be normal.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. I don't remember the exact number. I don't\rknow whether Darwin [Beck] has it. Well, this year we're estimating\rthe individual tax refunds to be somewhere on the order of $48\rbillion. In 1979, total refunds were $36 billion. Reading back, in\rrecent years they were, in billions of dollars, 36, 34, 31, and 29.\rSo you can see that it's a quantum jump this year on the order of $12\rbillion. In March of the previous four years the refunds were around\r$9-1/2 to $10 billion; this year they will be around $13.7 billion,\raccording to these estimates. So it's a jump of $4 billion in March\rand roughly $3 to $4 billion in April.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rWho would like to make some general\r\rcomments?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLES. I would just like to respond to the one question\ryou raised about farm credit.\r\r\f-21-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rWell, respond more generally, too.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLES. We have recently done a survey of our country\rbanks and they tell us they are as tight as a drum, and the farmers\rtell us [the banks] are as tight as a drum. Yet we have very few of\rthe country banks trying to pass on those loans to the city banks,\rwhich are not tight as a drum. When we get behind that, [we find\rthat] they're passing them off like crazy to the PCAs and so on, but\rthey're reluctant to pass them off to their city correspondents simply\rbecause the price is so high. So it's not really a question of\ravailability in the normal sense, but a question of their\runwillingness at least to this point to try to pass those higher rates\ron to their farm customers who are used to substantially lower rates.\rNow, I don't like the implication of that, in terms of the direction\rwe seem to be going, which is to give preference to small businesses.\rBut I think that is the real issue in their mind. It's not that the\rmoney is not there; it's just that they're unwilling, so far at least,\rto contract for the higher price.\rThe only other comment I would make is that, like many\rothers, I was disappointed in the movement in the President's program\rfor fiscal 1980.\rThat puts a little extra burden on [monetary policy]\rfor this year. Therefore, to the extent that we do err, I think we're\rgoing to have to err on the tighter side rather than the easier side.\rIf the deficit in\rFor fiscal 1981, I favor the reverse of that.\rfiscal 1980 is around $35 to $40 billion and then in fact [the budget]\rreally does get balanced in fiscal 1981, that's a $35 to $40 billion\r[swing] in one year.

MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, our staff has about the same\reconomic forecast as the Board's staff. I have a gut feeling that if\rthe forecast is wrong, the result is likely to be a deeper recession.\rI am thinking primarily in terms of the financial strains that the\rsystem will be under. I think we've all been amazed at the\rwillingness of consumers and businessmen to take on loans at extremely\rhigh rates. And it seems to me the counterpart of this is that we may\rgo into a recession [with] an awful lot of strains that are likely to\rlead to a deeper recession. One sector in particular that is showing\rgreat strains even in a forward moving economy is the savings banks;\rthe situation in New England is getting critical. I was a little\rshocked yesterday to find out that they may be in a position to have\rordinary access to the discount window within as little as two weeks.\rIf that's the case, we have an awful lot of issues to resolve. As you\rknow, in the past we have not loaned to organizations that were\rclearly insolvent. The fact is that all the savings banks in New\rEngland probably are insolvent if their assets are valued at current\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rThat's true of many banks, too.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. MORRIS. It's true of banks, too, but it's much more the\rcase with the savings banks, particularly in New England where the\raverage yield on their portfolios is very much lower than on the West\rCoast. That's because (a) we've been a slow growing region; and (b)\rNew Englanders don't change their houses as frequently as people in\rCalifornia do. That has led to a very old and very low yielding\rportfolio. So, not only do they have liquidity problems but they have\rvery serious earnings problems. Most of the savings banks in New\rEngland will probably show a deficit in earnings this year. There are\rother complications. There is this new dual rate which was set up to\rdeal with large commercial banks. I think that is perfectly fine, in\rlight of the fact that that's where the growth of credit has been most\rpronounced. But some of the most seriously troubled savings banks in\rNew England have assets in excess of $500 million. And the question\ris: Do we want to charge them the premium rate? Another problem is\rthat most of the savings banks in New England are not insured by the\rFDIC. We have a state fund which amounts to about $250 million. What\rdo we do when that fund is approaching its limits? We're going to\rhave an awful lot of issues in this whole area of lending to thrift\rinstitutions coming down on us very soon that will need to be\raddressed.\r\r\f-23-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

But I must say that through Thursday of last week,\rbusinessmen, and by that I mean mostly industrialists, were still\rtelling us in New York that they have great confidence in 1980 being a\rpretty good year--maybe not a record year but a pretty good year.\rIt's true that the money market banks and the medium size and large\rregional banks have all been approached for, and have granted, loan\rcommitments. And I know a few of them are very uncomfortable about\rmeeting those commitments.\rIn upstate New York some of the country\rbanks have been expressing a great deal of concern about the effect of\rthe current level of interest rates on local small businessmen. I\rthink local small businessmen are not unlike the farmers in the\rMidwest. There are stories that automobile dealers are just closing\rtheir businesses because they can't finance their inventories; rather\rthan go bankrupt, they retire. We have the impression that\rinventories are generally modest, although for some small retailers\rthey are pretty minimal.\rI have the impression that in New York City\rretail sales are pretty good, but that may not be the case outside of\rthe city. We've had some indications that in the first two months of\rthe year there have been price increases, particularly by the large\rgrocery chains.\rSome people explain that as the reason for all the\rcoupons we're getting in our Sunday newspapers.\rIn effect, it's\rgiving back the anticipatory price increase.\rWe also have in our area the same grave concerns that Frank\rhas in Massachusetts and New England generally. Our thrifts are in\rvery bad shape.\rThree of the ten largest mutual savings banks in New\rYork were in the red for 1979, and probably more will be in the red\rIt is disintermediation on the one side and terrible\rfor 1980.\rearnings on the other side.

So\rthe consumer may have a little extra money in his pocket. The Board\rstaff's projections of the outlook for the next 15 months seem pretty\rreasonable. In all the circumstances, my thought is that we should\rhang in there, which is probably what \"B\" does.\rThat would be my idea\rof hanging in there.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal, what wisdom do you bring us\rfrom Atlanta in your first presence here? Welcome.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, sir.\rIt's nice to be here at this\rinteresting time. Shifting to another part of the country, Mr.\r\r\f-24-\r\r3/18/80\r\rChairman, the Atlanta District shows a remarkable reversal in\rattitudes concerning the economic outlook, it seems to me. Just a\rmonth ago our directors and businessmen generally were virtually\rdiscounting any recession, even a mild one this year. But in a\rmonth's time that sentiment has changed remarkably, as I say. They\rnow almost uniformly see a recession developing and perhaps a deeper\rrecession developing later this year. That even comes from our South\rFlorida directors who had been reporting very, very bullish conditions\rright through last Friday. These sentiments, of course, were voiced\rbefore the President's program and the Federal Reserve program. It's\rinteresting to note that this change is attitudinal and not based on\rany real change in basic economic conditions. Conditions in the\rDistrict generally are about the same as they were, although, of\rcourse, we have had some softness in real estate sales and\rconstruction activity and a slowing in retail sales. That has been\rreflected, too, in a less rapid run-up in bank credit than in other\rparts of the country. But the perception of the future is that we're\rin for a very difficult time. Our business people and directors see\rautomobile dealers, farmers, small business people, and thrifts being\rhurt pretty badly and I think there is a real fear at this point of a\rcredit crunch coming along. While I don't have any data, and my staff\rhasn't given me any data about small banks, I have an intuitive\rfeeling that some of the small banks in the District are probably in\rmuch the same condition as savings and loans, although perhaps not to\rthe same degree. My personal feeling, after hearing all of this from\rpeople around the District, is that the pessimism is perhaps a little\roverdone. Recession, in my judgment, would not be all that bad if we\rare going to get prices under control.\rIn terms of policy, it seems to me that we've got to get the\rmonetary aggregates under control. February was perhaps a one-month\raberration, but there was a run-up in the aggregates. That, together\rwith negative market reaction to the President's program, is really\rgoing to fuel inflationary expectations. Indeed, as has been remarked\rhere, with energy costs increasing in the short term we could have an\rincrease in inflation. That is bound to cause consumers to lack\rconfidence in what has been done by the Administration, and we could\rhave an increase in inflationary expectations with the obvious\rresults. So my judgment, Mr. Chairman, which is a little different\rfrom the staff's at the Atlanta Bank, is to err on the side of greater\rrestraint. While alternative B seems to me a viable alternative,\rwhereas I would not consider alternative A to be viable, my preference\rwould be to go for something along the lines of alternative C to\rdemonstrate in the near term to the markets that we're going to\rcontinue with this program of restraint.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Black.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are in general agreement with\rIf we were to shade it a little, we'd\rwhat the staff has [projected].\rshade it along the lines that Frank Morris described because of the\runrest we see in financial markets, along with weaker housing and also\rprobably weakness in investment, all of which we think may be more\rthan the staff is estimating. I would add one other caveat and that\ris the feeling on our part that the international situation may be\rweaker than is generally being assumed. So we would shade the\rforecast toward a little deeper decline than the staff has indicated.\rBy the same token, we would expect perhaps a more rapid recovery. The\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-25-\r\rstaff is actually showing no growth in real GNP between the fourth\rquarter of '80 and the fourth quarter of '81, and we think [GNP\rgrowth] will probably be positive.\rOn the policy side, it seems to me that the best thing we\rcould do is to continue the policy we've been following. I think you\rsaid it all, and very well, yesterday before those bankers when you\rstressed that the backbone of our policy still remains our efforts to\rcontrol the aggregates. Not everyone heard you yesterday; there may\rbe some general doubt that we'll do that and some expectation that\rwe'll back away. So, one could make a case for going with alternative\rC. But it seems to me that alternative B is strong enough to\runderscore our determination. The rates of growth in the aggregates\rfor the last part of that six-month period are substantially below\rwhat we actually had in the first three months, or think we had in the\rfirst three months. They are below our targets, so \"B\" seems to us to\rbe the best of the alternatives.\rSo far as the federal funds range is concerned, I would\rprefer to drop the top and also the bottom of that range. I think we\rare now to the point where we can do that. I would not want to raise\rthe lower end, a possible alternative suggested in the Bluebook, since\rI would like us to be in a position to let rates come down pretty\rfast, if they do tend to do that in the face of a controlled set of\rgrowth rates in the aggregates. I am sure that the Committee is not\rgoing to agree to abandoning that range; against that background,\r11-1/2 to 18 percent looks about right to us.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Winn.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, the crosscurrents are so extreme\rthat it's difficult to sort them out and get a fix, particularly with\rlast weekend's adjustments not being factored into many people's\rthinking. Three or four things, I think, are interesting. One is\rthat we turned off commercial construction--that is, apartment houses,\roffice buildings, and so forth--completely in October, and it turned\rback on in an unbelievable fashion in January and early February.\rWe've turned it off again, I think, really in the last couple of\rweeks; there are just no deals being made. But the profits picture\rthat is coming through on the deals that have been made are so unreal\rthat it's almost unbelievable. With the acceleration of rents and\rwith [builders'] fixed costs not moving up, the flows back to profits\rare very, very high. That's particularly true where tax relief\roccurred, in California and Texas and places like that. In spite of\rincreased operating expenses the profits picture is almost\runbelievable. So, if we get any stability in [interest rates], my\rguess is that those [activities] will explode on us again as building\rpicks up.\rThe second thing I'd report is that the major chemical\rcompanies are showing profits in the first months of the year, and\rI've seen figures for month-to-month developments. While these are\rworldwide operations and one can't sort it out [for individual\rcountries], it was interesting to me that the price increases from\rNow, I don't know how the price increases were divided up worldwide,\rbut these are pretty substantial price changes. They have those\r[changes] built right into June--this was before last Friday--so\r\r\f-26-\r\r3/18/80\r\rthere's a big move in some of these factors.\runbelievable.\r\rAnd their earnings are\r\rWhile building has phased down and the automobile industry is\rstaying a bit soft, [businesses] in our area are reporting\runbelievable orders and profits expectations. Our railroad people are\rreporting really quite good operating results, much better than they\rhad projected. And this is across the line, [even] with the downward\rpush occurring in their automobile business. Our banks are showing a\rmixed picture. Many of them are pretty well loaned up and are not\rseeing too much demand because of rates in agriculture and some other\rareas.\rOn the other hand, they are not seeing any problem with\rrespect to delinquencies or slow pays or any of the normal [signs] one\rsees on that score. We had, of course, in the last couple of weeks\rthis tremendous drive to increase commitments. Their customers were\rtold that lines of credit wouldn't be honored and they had to convert\rthose into revolving notes. So there was a tremendous scramble to\roffset the anticipated [government credit] control system by such\rthings as price increases and wage increases and also by an explosion,\rreally, in lines of credit. They were taking to their boards demands\rfor loans that were 5 to 6 times their normally weekly increase.\rWe really don't know what the outlook is because we don't\rknow how people will adjust; it's a crude guess that we're making. In\rview of your statement yesterday and other concerns, I am very\rconcerned about the [potential] April bulge, which could be much\rlarger than is shown here. And unless we react to that, our own\rcredibility is going to be questioned even though [we expect the bulge\rto unwind].\rWe can't say \"Oh well, it's going to go down in May and\rI have a feeling that we have to\rrespond to current developments. While the targets of \"B\" seem to me\rappropriate, in order to make those targets I'd like to raise that\rfunds rate range by 2 points, let's say, to 13-1/2 to 20 percent, to\rgive the Desk [the flexibility to respond], if necessary, if we get\rthis kind of bulge. I don't want to raise it just to raise it. But\runless we respond to the increase, which could be quite large in this\rperiod, we're going to have a real credibility problem.\rI am impressed with those who watch the Desk. They will tell\ryou exactly what the intervention points were; they don't see any\rchange in terms of our intervention points which [they say are\rapparent] to the market. People, in spite of all the changes, are\rreading [our operations] as if we were operating under the old\rguidelines.

BALLES. At times like this, Mr. Chairman, regional\rdifferences do show up rather starkly. West of the Rockies there are\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-27-\r\rprecious few signs of any present or impending recession, particularly\rWith the obvious exception of\ras our directors view [the situation].\rhousing and autos, things seem to be moving along at a very rapid\rrate. There is continued strength in consumer spending; it's almost\rhard to believe. I believe much of that still reflects a \"buy it now\rbefore it gets more expensive\" approach. Labor demand in defenserelated industries and high technology industries such as electronics\rand aerospace is contributing to continued strength in employment in\rthe District. Loan demand remains strong at banks and, despite the\rrecent flooding in California, agriculture all around the West seems\rto be in pretty good shape. I think the difference between West of\rthe Rockies and what Mark was reporting probably stems from the\rpredominance of large branch systems around the West. I know that in\rCalifornia our three largest banks are among the three largest\ragricultural lenders anywhere in the country. And, of course, a good\rpart of that lending is to agri-business, but they take reasonably\rgood care of the smaller farmers as well--to the extent that we have\rsome of those around the West, and we do. Demand for lumber you'd\rthink would be falling out of bed because of housing, and yet exports\rto the Pacific Basin area have made up a good part of that. So, in\rshort, while this may not be applicable to the national scene, our\rdirectors just don't see any signs of recession in our part of the\rcountry nor do they believe one is ahead for the regional economy.\rWith regard to the national scene, it's obviously a different picture.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\rof the national scene.\r\rYour area covers a not insignificant part\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

We recently had the first of the ABA/FRB\rseminars, which originally was supposed to cover the subject of\rregulation under that plan that you encouraged us to get into. We\rhad, I thought, a very good meeting.

There was quite a bit\rof skepticism expressed in that audience about whether we were going\rto stick to our announced target of ongoing restraint because of what\rthose February numbers were showing--and they were aware of them by\rthen--on the money supply. Another month like that would really\rundermine our credibility a great deal, so I share Willis' view about\rdoing something about the April bulge if we can. And I think we\rprobably should.

GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The agricultural\rsector has been reasonably well covered in the comments made by Mark\rWilles and Bob Mayo. Our banks supplying credit to the agricultural\rsector are very tight with respect to loan/deposit ratios. But\rcontrary to what Mark suggested, we have found that the country banks\rare facing up to their problem and raising their interest rates to\ragricultural borrowers. They have no outlet for the loans even at\rthese higher rates, however, because the correspondent banks are not\rprepared to pick them up, even at a discount, at the rates the credit\ris being extended. [Cattlemen] are withdrawing from filling the\rfeedlots again as they turn their present stock, which implies less\rmeat in the future I suppose. Secondly, as we go into the planting\rseason, a period of high agricultural [loan] demand, there is a bit of\ra safety valve, if you will. There is still a lot of grain in the\rhands of the producers, which can be sold at the lower prices now\rprevailing. That would suggest that there will be a considerable\r\r\f-29-\r\r3/18/80\r\rsqueeze on farm profits in the period ahead. But I don't think the\rrestraint program will have a great impact on the agricultural sector\rimmediately. The grain embargo probably will have as great an impact\rWhat I am really trying to say is that\ras the restraint program.\rthere are tough times ahead in the agricultural sector.\rTurning to policy, Dave Eastburn captured my concern very\rwell. In the Bluebook we are looking at a 4-month period instead of\rthe usual 2-month period or even a quarter. It seems to me that\rcredibility of the Federal Reserve System may be the more important\raspect, at least of near-term policy. The potential bulge in April is\rpart of the problem. I'd hate to go back to the [procedures used]\rprior to October 6 and focus on interest rates. But I think it's\rextremely important--for international and domestic reasons,\rinflationary anticipation, and other things--that we not permit [the\rfunds] rate to come down very far in the next month or two. As a\rI would be inclined to move\rresult, \"B\" looks very reasonable to me.\ra little closer to \"C\" because of the potential for interest rate\rmovements if indeed the demand for money begins to ease somewhat\rbecause of the lower projection of growth.

How that will roll into the [next] two months, I don't know.\rSo, \"B\" would be reasonable and I would be inclined to move a little\rtoward \"C\" if that were the sense of the Committee. I would also set\rthe federal funds range by raising the lower end and reestablishing\rthe 4 percent spread, thus coming out with a 14 to 18 percent range\rwith the anticipation that interest rates would remain in the upper\rhalf of that range for at least the next 60 days.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Roos.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Well, [Mr. Guffey and I] are both from Missouri,\rand my approach to [policy] will underscore the great diversity of\rthinking that occurs in the great state of Missouri, Mr. Chairman.\rVery briefly, the general condition of the economy as we see it is a\rfairly level one with the exception of the building and real estate\rareas and automobile sales and manufacturing, which are obviously\rquite weak. Just last week we had a group of savings and loan people\rin for lunch, and they reported very severe trouble, as your savings\rbank people are experiencing, Frank.

Mr. Chairman, I would only add on the agricultural\rside that I think some of the trauma accompanying the announcement of\rthe grain embargo has subsided. There is a much calmer approach to\rthe problem and a little more Federal government credibility than\r[earlier] in the farm community, although they are still somewhat\rskeptical. We are, of course, in a very poor position on autos and\rhousing throughout our District. But capital goods are still running\rquite strong. This is typical of what one might call \"this stage of\rI feel more comfortable than I did last month with the\rthe cycle.\"\rGreenbook [forecast], yet I would not be surprised if we got down to a\rminus 5 percent quarter [for GNP] before this forthcoming recession is\rover. I think we are getting closer, much closer, to the peaks that\rwe keep visualizing and postponing, and we could easily have a credit\rcrunch--though I don't know how best to define that--perhaps in the\rnext 4 to 6 weeks.\rHaving said that, I would be happy enough with \"B,\" but I\rwould tilt also a little toward \"C,\" agreeing with what Dave had to\rsay. On the federal funds range, though, I would just leave the\r[lower limit of] 11-1/2 percent. It has no real significance now and\rI wouldn't want to see us push that up at this point. It restricts\rour image of flexibility when it gets published. Instead, I would\rjust go to the 20 percent on the up side and be done with it,\rrecognizing that that would give us cover for an interim period,\rrather than have to go back frequently to jiggle it up another half or\rone percentage point.

Well, Mr. Chairman, generally I go along with the\rstaff forecast. It seems to me that the new anti-inflationary program\rwill have the effect of making the coming recession deeper than it\rmight have been and might even bring it on sooner. If I have any\rskepticism at all [about the Greenbook forecast], it's in the area of\rthe timing of the recession. The economy appears to be continuing\rstrong, or relatively so. If I read the Redbook correctly, most of\rthe businessmen around the country report remarkable equanimity in the\rface of the economic situation; they just don't seem to be excessively\rconcerned about--or, in any case, feel confident that they can deal\rwith--whatever is down the road. It's pretty difficult to find\revidence of weakness in the economy aside from housing and autos; one\rhas to look pretty hard. One has to look behind the industrial\rproduction figures to see that there would have been a decline in\rindustrial production had production of autos and parts not risen.\rAlso one has to note that capacity utilization in the primary\rprocessing industries and materials-producing industries has declined.\rAnd, of course, the average workweek has declined somewhat. These are\rabout the only signs I see of any emerging weakness.\rSo, I feel that our posture at the present time is about\rright, with the appropriate tautness in financial markets. I don't\rthink alternatives B and C leave us much to choose between. Actually,\r[for M1] the difference between them amounts to about $900 million at\rthe end of June, and that doesn't strike me as being very much money\rout of the total money supply. So, it doesn't really matter too much\r\r\f-31-\r\r3/18/80\r\rto me whether we choose alternative B or C. If we choose alternative\rB, it appears that we will have a slightly larger volume of money\rstarting in April and a less substantial rate of increase in the third\rand fourth quarters. On the other hand, if we choose alternative C,\rwe will have a lower rate of increase in the second quarter and a\rhigher rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters. Given the\rcurrent situation, it would seem to me better on balance to lean\rharder in the second quarter and increase the restraint then; that\rwill [show through] in the third quarter and allow for a slightly\rhigher rate of increase in those quarters when we expect the recession\rto hit. Alternative C would probably be more consistent with that\rscenario than alternative B, but I have to repeat that really it\rdoesn't make a great deal of difference. On the funds rate, for now I\rwould favor a ceiling of about 18 percent, but I am prepared to raise\rthe ceiling if market conditions [warrant].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Wallich.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

These high interest rates may hit some borrowers\rvery hard but they don't seem to hit others at all, and the net effect\rone can't predict. I see that Charlie Schultz, after the President's\rprogram was announced, predicted a 2-1/2 percent rise in GNP for 1981,\rso he doesn't seem to think that this has a very powerful impact. I\ram particularly concerned about the inflation forecast. I view the\rforecasts of both our staff and the Administration as wildly\roptimistic. The very slight recession that we are anticipating is\rvery unlikely to make that kind of dent in the inflation rate. Of\rcourse, we have a history of always underestimating the rate of\rinflation.\rI am aware of the repercussions of a firm policy at savings\rbanks, small commercial banks, and elsewhere. As these [problems]\rcome toward us, we have to be prepared to meet them, and I think we\rshould meet them in a liberal way--stretch our powers as far as they\rcan reasonably be stretched. But we should not be obsessed by the\rconcern that the recession may last a little longer or even be a\rlittle deeper. As I look back over our record, I am impressed that we\rnever stopped fighting recession. We moved imperceptibly from\rfighting the last recession and its consequences into worrying about\rthe next recession. And that recession concern essentially has\rdominated our thinking and has brought us now to 15 percent inflation.\rIt's a situation with very poor options, but I lean toward the firmer\rThe market has not been impressed\rones. That is, I lean toward \"C.\"\rby our policy package except abroad. The bond market hasn't responded\rvery much. Short-term rates are actually down. I think there is a\rreal danger that if we now give the impression that we are about to\rrelax our general credit restraint behind a shield of selective credit\rcontrols, we will get the worst of both worlds. We'll get the\rselective controls not working--I have not been very enthusiastic\rabout them anyway--but we should do what we can not to disavow them\rcompletely. That is best done by not throwing any burden on them and\rby holding to a firm general control. I think it's important at this\rtime not to convey the impression that the regular discount rate,\rwhich wasn't changed, is the discount rate and that essentially we\rhave taken evasive action in trying to avoid raising the discount\rrate. We should so operate on nonborrowed reserves that there is a\r\r\f-32-\r\r3/18/80\r\rgood amount of borrowing at the surcharge so that the rate acquires\rsome credibility.\rIf we\rFinally, I share the concern about the April bulge.\rhave taken 15 percent out through the seasonal adjustment, there must\rbe a lot of money out there--in reality, people don't draw checks on\rseasonally adjusted checking accounts--and that may have its effect.\rSo in addition to \"C\" generally, I would like to see a funds range of\r14 to 20 percent.

Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that our posture\r[If it was]\rof restraint had begun to bite before this past weekend.\rbiting before this past weekend, presumably it will bite a little more\rnow. I have to admit I've held such views on several earlier\roccasions, so I don't know how much weight to put on my current view.\rWe did hear reports last week, however, of several real estate\rdevelopers being cut off by large banks in our District. Our recent\rsurvey of the agricultural credit situation does not reveal the\rtightness that has been reported elsewhere in the country. And I do\rhave the impression that our farmers are among those who are carrying\rexcessive inventories at the present time, largely in the interest of\rdeferring income tax liabilities.\rI don't know to what extent the Greenbook projections assume\rthat the capacity of people to adjust to an inflationary environment\rIn my area\ris behind us or to what extent it might still be ahead us.\rSome\rI see indications of a good deal of capacity to adjust further.\rof this, of course, flows from the firm linkage that seems to have\rdeveloped between that area and foreign sources of funds for\rinvestment. Just to indicate the extreme to which this seems to be\rI am told that at the present time builders in our major\rgoing:\rcenters who complete expensive houses which they don't sell promptly\rto local purchasers sell them to foreign buyers who then furnish them\rand rent them out. And this is a means of investing funds at\robviously very low rates of return currently for the purpose of\rgetting into real estate, in this instance in fairly modest-size\rpackages. There are a lot of small business firms being sold to\rforeigners as well, all the way from the family-size motel to the\rfamily-size manufacturing firm. That seems to be going on yet at a\rI note that the oil drillers have been in Washington\rrapid pace.\rrecently; they have about as much reason for being here at the present\rtime as the farmers had a year ago and two years ago. The number of\ractive rigs is at a 23-year high; the increase during the past month\rwas almost spectacular and the increase over the past year was also\rvery strong.\rSo, the signals are mixed. As I say, it seems that credit is\rbiting but activity is still very strong and the outlook is strong. I\rthink there's also a good deal of capacity yet on the part of\rindividuals to adjust the management of their financial situation to\rcontinued expectations of inflation. Possibly one indication of this\ris the alacrity with which they are willing to give up accumulated\rinterest on CDs for the purpose of turning them in and getting a new\rone which will carry a higher yield. This has resulted in actual\rlines of people at banks in some recent weeks when the new rate\rannounced was significantly higher than the rates on outstanding CDs.\r\r\f-33-\r\r3/18/80\r\rAs to monetary policy, the \"C\" proposal seems preferable\rtoday, primarily for the reasons that Steve Axilrod outlined in his\roral remarks. Others have commented along that line. That's all I\rhave to say.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Teeters.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of alternative \"B.\"\rEven [with \"B\"] the rate of growth [for M-1A] in the period from April\rto June would be dropping to almost half of what it was in the first\rtwo months of the year; even compared with the first three months,\rit's very low. If we go to alternative \"C,\" we're going to be cutting\rgrowth relative to the first three months in half, and that implies to\rme a very stringent credit market. If people think they've had\rstringency these [past several] months, it's only going to get worse\rif we go to the more stringent specifications. I will be very brief:\rI support alternative \"B\" as it now stands with the 11-1/2 to 18\rpercent range on the federal funds rate.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Partee.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't know what's going to happen to the\reconomy. Perhaps I am associating with people who are in difficult\rsituations and have become very pessimistic, and it may be affecting\rme. So, I may be more pessimistic than I ought to be. I would point\rout that the projection seems to me very, very sensitive to the saving\rrate. The projection shows no increase in the saving rate in the\rsecond quarter and, therefore, the second quarter continues to be not\ra bad quarter. If in fact the saving rate should increase in the\rsecond quarter, it would be a bad quarter for the economy. And that\rcould happen. On the other hand, the projection has sizable increases\rin the saving rate in the third and fourth quarters, and those are the\rquarters of major recessionary movement. Whether those increases\roccur or don't occur will affect the character of that pattern. So,\rwe still have the uncertainty that has been with us for some time, and\rthat is: What is motivating people and how might [their behavior] be\rchanging?\rI do feel that everything that has happened in the last month\rhas increased liquidity preference. The rise in rates, which was very\rsharp and very noticeable, and the cutting off of credit cards to\rcertain low income groups, even before the President's program, have\rbeen played up in a major way in the local press here in Washington.\rThe feeling that one might need to rely on one's resources more and on\rother people's resources less in the period ahead leads to an increase\rin liquidity preference, which would tend to give us rather larger\rmoney numbers, generally speaking, relative to GNP than was the case\rbefore. I also think that the relationship between M1, or narrow cash\rbalances, and the real economy is changing adversely. That is, it\rtakes more and more M1 in order to get a particular real income; or we\rget less and less real outcome for the same M1 we had before because\rof [higher] cash balances, to the extent that people are buying more\rwith cash and not using gasoline credit cards and so forth. The\rcredit lines that have been extended, many of which may call for\rcompensating balances, and the fact that we are forecasting more and\rmore inflation, mean either that a given M1 is going to carry with it\ra higher interest rate or lower real activity, or both. And I think\rboth is probably the case.\r\r\f-34-\r\r3/18/80\r\rSo it seems to me that it's just the wrong time to be\rdeparting from the notion of a rather normative, reasonable increase\rin the monetary aggregates. I would very much resist moving to a\rlower aggregate path like alternative C. If we get the recession,\rEmmett, which I believe we will, I think we'll find that the demand\rfor money in the second half of the year will be low enough so that\rour problem won't be so much the upper end of our range but keeping\rgrowth within the lower end of our range.\rThat brings me to one more point, which is that I would hate\rto have somebody ask me what I was doing during the crash and have to\rremark that I was defending our credibility. The people who say let's\rkeep those interest rates up there, regardless of what happens, are\rreally walking into a major trap for the economy and for the Federal\rReserve. I very much want to disassociate myself from that. I would\rgo with alternative B. I would adjust that path and slice a little\roff April and put it into May. I think that has the same effect, if\rthere is a bulge in April, as going with alternative C. I am\rsympathetic to the idea that we need more room in the funds rate range\rbecause there is a very good chance of a big bulge, and the Manager\rought to be able to move if there is a bulge. If there is no bulge, I\rwouldn't expect him to move. Therefore, I rather like the idea of a\r14 to 20 percent range on the funds rate which, with the rate now at\rabout 16-1/2 to 17 percent, means we have some room on both the up\rside and the down side.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Let me make a few observations that\rFirst of all, it's clear\roccurred to me in listening to all this.\rthat the economy is fairly level, so any month we look at these\rfigures we're going to find some things down and some things up. What\rthat means for the future isn't very clear. There's considerable\rstrength and resiliency over broad areas of the economy or it wouldn't\rbe holding level or a bit on the up side in the face of a decline in\rhousing and a decline in autos and some other industries. What stands\rout to me is that we haven't any room to grow here, given the declines\rin productivity and other pressures on the economy. And if we tried\rto stimulate growth very much, we really would have no chance of\rdealing with the inflationary psychology; we'd in fact face a blow-off\ron the inflation side if we don't already have a blow-off.\rSecondly, in my opinion--and everybody can be his own\rpsychologist--at this point we don't have many believers in the view\rthat inflation is about to ease off or, indeed, that the economy is\rabout to fall out of bed. There is more nervousness than there used\rto be and some people are beginning to question whether they shouldn't\rIt was characterized for me in talking to some\rchange their views.\rfarmers from Iowa the other day, and I think their attitudes are\rprobably similar to [those held by people in] other sectors of the\reconomy. A couple of them sitting near me said that they had bought\rsome land last year at prices they considered exorbitant but they\rbought it confidently with the thought that prices would be even more\rexorbitant this year. And they are wondering whether they made a good\rbuy. In fact, they're beginning to wonder whether they could sell it\ror should sell it, but they haven't seen any evidence of a decline in\rland prices up until now. They were getting worried but they hadn't\rseen anything. I suspect that a lot of industrialists are thinking\rthe same thing in their own way. The fiscal policy program--and I\rthink it has been underestimated a bit in the public press for a\rvariety of reasons, political and otherwise--I certainly don't think\rwas strong enough to change these attitudes in any significant way.\rIt may be to the contrary in the feeling that if anything is going to\rbe done, it's going to be done through the credit policy side.\rSo far as the outlook is concerned, it seems murky to me. I\rhear all these fears of recession and I even share them. But if you\rask me analytically whether they are any more certain now than they\rwere a year ago when we began hearing the same things, I don't know.\rI am pretty well convinced that it's going to start some time and that\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-36-\r\rthere's a risk, when it starts, that it may be greater than anybody is\rprojecting. But I thought that a year ago, too. Just when it will\rreally start, who knows? I know we--all of us, I think--have\rmisjudged the timing again and again. I share the thoughts that some\rpeople have expressed, most recently Governor Schultz, that we better\rget this over with in terms of minimizing the total pain over a period\rof time. I am worried about those financial institutions, and the\rworst thing that can happen to them is [for us to] fail to do the job\rand get the interest rate turn fairly soon. But the way to get the\rinterest rate turned is not by hastening it prematurely. If we have\ranother false start, we'll be in considerable trouble even though that\rclearly runs the risk of overkill. That risk is greater in its\rinverse logic than if it's not killed at all; we'll be faced with the\rsame dilemma later on.\rIn that connection, in getting out of our dilemma as best we\rcan, I put considerable emphasis on one aspect of the voluntary\rprogram, which is to get banks to begin saying \"no\" on some loans and\rnot to put all the pressure on raising the prime rate. If the loan\rdemands come home to roost [and they take the latter approach], it\rwill exert pressures throughout the money market as they go out and\rtry to finance the loan increase. If we accomplish nothing else in\rthe next few weeks--and I think the time is very short--if we can get\rthat message to the banks and they can get the message to their\rcustomers, we have some chance of at least moderating the short-run\rinterest rate pressures. I don't think we have a chance of\rdissipating them but we do of moderating them and getting some element\rof rationing in the area of the market where it does not now exist,\rnamely among the bigger business borrowers. I would urge you to move\rpromptly on that voluntary program and get the questionnaires out and\rto begin on occasion, or maybe more than on occasion, a consultative\rprocess with the banks, particularly the biggest banks in your area\rvery promptly.\rWe have the April problem that has been referred to, and all\rof these things incline me toward resolving doubts in the direction of\rgreater tightness in the very short run rather than the opposite. The\rworst thing we could do is to indicate some backing off at this point\rwhen we have an announced anti-inflation program. We have political\rsupport and understanding for what we have been doing. People don't\rexpect it to be too easy. There is an understanding that a lot of\rburden has been placed on credit policy, and there's a willingness to\rbe supportive for the moment in that connection. I would not give all\rthat much weight to the degree of support we're going to get if this\ris dragged out indefinitely and we have to go through this process\ronce again.\rWhere that leaves me in terms of \"B\" and \"C\"--I don't think\ranybody mentioned \"A\"--is that at this particular juncture I find the\rfocus a little long, frankly, for me to come to any great conviction\rI share much of Governor Rice's feelings about\rbetween \"B\" and \"C.\"\rthose alternatives. I do attach some significance to the fact that if\rwe took \"B\" literally, while the numbers as presented on page 6 of the\rBluebook look low, [they imply] running above our annual targets in\rthe way we calculate those targets. If we were going to be at the\rmidpoint of the annual target, it would require a considerable decline\rin the second half of the year from the 5-1/4 percent quarterly growth\r\r\f-37-\r\r3/18/80\r\rpattern implied by \"B;\" and even \"C\" is above the midpoint of the\rannual target for M-1A. You are shaking your head \"no.\"\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS.\rthe rest of the year.\r\r\"C\" would mean 4-1/4 percent per quarter for\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. \"C\" is 5 percent for the first two\rquarters, as I have calculated it, and the midpoint [of our annual\rtarget] is 4-3/4 percent. It comes close to the midpoint but is a\rlittle above.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rYes, because February is behind us.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, there's no question that we have\rrecorded a high number for February, which has contributed to that\rBut again, I [wouldn't] worry too\rBut we have recorded it.\rresult.\rmuch about where this comes out within a range of 1/4 or 1/2 or even\r3/4 percentage point on a February-to-June number, since all of those\rdifferences are within our normal range of error anyway. That doesn't\rexcite me terribly at this point. Other people may have different\rshadings but whether we're looking at \"B\" or \"C\" or something in\rbetween in the four-month time perspective, I believe it catches the\rspirit of what a number of people are saying anyway, to say that in\rthe next month or so--certainly before we next meet--we should be\rleaning toward taking our chances on being certain to be near those\rI am not saying we can\rnumbers in that very short-run period.\rguarantee that we will be within those ranges at any expense of\rinterest rates or anything else. But when we're making up the paths\rand deciding what the level of borrowing should be or whatever, we\rought to be resolving doubts and making sure March is as low as\rprojected and April is no greater than projected or that both of them\rare lower than projected because that's where our principal\rvulnerability lies--in this two-month period. If April is anywhere\rnear as strong as the New York figures suggest, we'll be above the \"B\"\ralternative. I feel quite certain that we at least ought to be\rleaning in the other direction, and reasonably hard, during these next\rsix weeks or so. We don't want to give the market a false signal if\rthe money supply comes in very low for a couple of weeks that we are\rrelaxing too quickly during this immediate time frame, when we've just\rannounced these new programs and there is the kind of feeling in the\rcountry that I think exists. There is plenty of time before June to\rtake account of any shortfalls we might have in the money supply if\rthat happy event should occur in the very immediate future. I don't\rknow what the March data are going to show. If March came in under\rMr. Axilrod's projections and we were facing--in terms of our seat-ofthe-pants judgment or the pit of our stomach or whatever--the kind of\rbulge that is projected for April, we ought to be delighted with a low\rSo, I am suggesting that we lean in that direction.\rAnd whether we come out between \"B\" and \"C\" over a four-month\rperspective concerns me less than [that we take] this posture I have\rsuggested before the next meeting. We could reconcile my longer-term\rconcerns by making it someplace between \"B\" and \"C\" but in the end I\rcould probably tolerate either. But I do feel rather strongly about\rnot giving any false signals in the very short run at the risk of any\roverkill that might be implied by that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. Would you consider taking a shorter period of\rtime--in other words, setting a target for March through May?\r\r\f-38-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I could, but it's probably going to take a\rlot of arithmetic here. As I say, we're going to be meeting again in\ra month and we can fine-tune the quarter further then. So that really\rconcerns me less than an understanding about what our posture should\rbe in the next month and how we will reconcile all the doubts and\rerrors and fluctuations in figures that we're going to have during\rthat time period.

I think we're in a perverse situation here. If\rthose commitments are ever drawn upon, the banks are going to be\rpanicky and they're going to be putting their rates way up to protect\rthemselves.\rSo you can have something concrete to shoot at--and let me\rjust say again that the least of my concerns is precisely whether it's\r\"B\" or \"C\" over a full four-month period--and to capture slightly the\rFor M-1A,\rflavor of what I am saying, let me suggest the following:\ruse 2-3/4 percent for the February-to-June number; put the funds range\rat 14 to 20 percent, say, which again is no goal to shoot at obviously\rin either direction, but I'm trying to pick up the flavor of what has\rbeen said around the table; and aim at $2.7 or $2-3/4 billion or\rsomething like that in borrowings in the very short run.

I don't mind going to [a\rceiling of] 20 percent, but I don't particularly want to raise the\rfloor.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I find it very difficult to conceive that\rwe're going to get to the lower end of the range before the next\rmeeting anyway. This is probably the least important number we put\rdown. And from that [perspective], it doesn't bother me.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. I agree with that, but the idea of keeping the\rrange wide in case we do get into a crisis situation appeals to me.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE. It does seem to me, though, Nancy, [given that]\rwe have raised the discount rate since the last meeting, that to\raccept that floor, which is slightly below the 12 percent discount\rOperationally, one has to figure that banks\rrate [unintelligible].\rwould first pay off the borrowings before the [funds rate] went lower.\rSo, logically, there is a basis for a one point increase.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. I still think the wider the range, the better,\rbecause we really don't know what we will be getting into in the next\rtwo or three months. And the possibility of a credit crunch is out\rthere; it's not an impossibility at all.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rIt's quite probable.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

TEETERS.\r\rIt depends on what happens afterwards, Henry.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we're talking about the visuals of\rwhat is announced a month from now and I can't convince myself that\rthis is an absolutely crucial decision. One could argue that raising\r\r\f-41-\r\r3/18/80\r\rthe funds range is consistent and reinforces the notion that we're not\rbacking off. On the other hand, if we don't change it, it can be\rinterpreted as an indefinite widening of the range.\rWell, we have a small mechanical problem. It is small in one\rsense; I don't know that it affects anything. The staff has written\rthe directive tentatively to include a growth range for the whole\rfirst half of the year, which makes it even less sensitive to what\rI don't know whether\rwe're talking about in the next month or two.\rthat's a good way to word it or not. The only problem with wording it\rfor the second quarter--and we can all convert this into a secondquarter growth rate--is that we don't know exactly what the [firstquarter] base is at this point. The equivalent of what I suggested,\rwhich is 2-3/4 percent for 4 months, would be about 4-3/8 percent for\rthe first half. And that begins to look a little too fine. We could\rsay 4-1/4 percent. The last published target we had was 4-1/2 percent\rfor the first quarter, which I take it we will exceed.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rMake it 4-1/2 percent for the half-year then.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can put in 4-1/2 percent for the halfIt doesn't capture the flavor that I\ryear, which is right on \"B.\"\rthought [we might want to convey] of putting it a little below that.\rBut in very round numbers, it's not very different. When we get down\rto the point of how to express it within a 1/4 of a point, it's\rdifficult. The 4-1/2 percent certainly implies no change. It implies\ra lower growth rate in the second quarter than in the first, given\rIt's a little easier than I suggested,\rwhat we know at the moment.\rbut I suppose we could take care of that by some language which says\rthat at least for the moment--I am talking about the period to the\rnext meeting--we want to be sure not to exceed [that growth rate].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. I think in October or sometime the language-not the number--was something like \"4-1/2 percent or a little less.\"\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, maybe we can use that language.\rI\rthink it captures what I am trying to say, maybe better than I said\rit. Well, let me review the bidding here.

And in terms of the projections given to us, we will\rlean to being within those projections for the March-April period in\rsetting the nonborrowed path target, interpreted as $2-3/4 billion of\rborrowings right now.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

What I am trying to get is some flavor.\rWe have to make a decision as to where to put [the initial borrowing\rassumption].\rI'd be perfectly happy to put it higher and resolve the\rdoubt that way in the first round. In any event [the staff] needs to\rknow what we're aiming for.\rI am saying that for the March-April\rfigure together we'd be unhappy if [money growth] were not at that\rrate and we'd rather tolerate a shortfall. Having said that, there's\rno promise we're going to confine [money growth] to that rate.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS.\r\rThen you can't really confine the borrowing.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't mean to confine it.\rAll I\ram looking for is some assumption to go on. If you want to forget\rabout that, we'll solve it otherwise on the understanding that we're\raiming for 4-1/2 percent or a little less [M-1A growth] for the first\rhalf of the year. Now that brings us basically to \"B\" or less.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. TIMLEN.\r\rDo you want to define \"little\"?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Well, nobody's talking about more or less\rbeing minus ten. We'll resolve these doubts on the side of less\rrather than more. And if that gets translated into the March-April\rnumber as projected, we'd be happy to come in lower than higher.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, just to be clear:\rAt the moment\rwe're projecting 4.6 percent [as the average M-1A growth for March and\r\r\f-43-\r\r3/18/80\r\rof this discussion, I would propose that we tend to even it out [over\rThat is, we'd target on something like\rthe four-month period ahead].\r3 percent or a little higher in March-April which would mean May-June\rwould be around 3 percent or thereabouts; the two periods would be\rroughly even. March would be low and April high, but pressed down\rrelative to what we show now, depending on what the data we get\rtomorrow look like.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I resist a little the precision that's\rimplied that we can make it 2 percent less than an uncertain\rprojection that-MR. AXILROD. Oh, no;\ron, not what we'd achieve.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rI was talking about what we'd target\r\rWell, that's one way of putting it.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. SCHULTZ.\rIf you did it that way, that would show real\rresistance to that April bulge, if it occurs.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Yes. We would be targeting on [a smaller]\rbulge. If it started coming in even as high as we have projected,\rwe'd begin resisting.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we should kid ourselves,\reither. If the New York projections turned out to be right and there\rwere enormous upward pressure [in April], I don't think we're saying\rwe would raise the federal funds rate to 25 percent in order to get\r[money growth] down to the plus 6 percent [upper limit of our longterm range for M-1A].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

And there would be some language in the discussion\rto reflect--though I'd hardly put it in these terms--that we want to\rtake particular care not to exceed that rate in the period immediately\rahead.

TEETERS.\r\rHow much lower?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we can take care of that in\rthe discussion. I was just trying to avoid some wording that relied\rupon an internal projection.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. I understand.

Well, I think we'd have to wait until we look\rat the numbers and Mr. Sternlight and I have a chance to chew it over.\rBut one thought would be simply to make March-April 3 percent and MayJune 3 percent in round terms and even it out. We generally tend to\ruse an even [pattern] if we can. It doesn't seem likely that growth\rin March and April will be even, but maybe for the two months it\rwouldn't be unreasonable to target it that way. Then if March turned\rnegative at minus 1 percent, say, April could be plus 7 percent. That\rOr if March turned out to be plus 2 percent,\rwould be an example.\rthen the April [path] would drop down to a plus 4 percent rate or\rIt may not be that even; it will depend on what\rsomething like that.\rit looks like.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

PRELL.I have no quarrel with anything you said, Mr.Chairman.Indeed, it's a point that I have made many times, and Ihave convinced myself that I should be very leery about presentingthese kinds of simulations.If I don't buy the model in the baselineforecast, why should I buy the differentials literally? Now they areprobably the best we can do systematically at this point because it'svery hard to juggle all of these variables in a judgmental fashion andcome up with a whole array of alternative simulations. And we aretrying to improve the model so we can have greater confidence. Ithink the key question the Committee has to ask is whether it believesthe baseline. For example, those who feel that the NAIRU is muchlower or that the true unemployment rate is lower relative to theNAIRU would have a different baseline path so that the moststimulative policy wouldn't necessarily yield higher inflation than weforecast. It might be comparable to what we forecast. Still, thepoint, I think, is that you only get a short-run benefit, and not along-run benefit, if you feel that over time higher inflation has anegative implication for economic efficiency and productivity in theeconomy. That, I think, is the key judgment you folks have to make.\f-42-7/5-6/94\n","1994-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. LINDSEY.\n","1994-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

PRELL.Ever?I don't believe so.Well, it might, though, in tax terms.The factis that our tax system isn't fully indexed; the effective corporatetax rate rises as inflation goes up, and that would raise the cost ofcapital, reduce investment, and lower productivity over the very longrun. That, I think, is probably embodied in our current model. Andit's one of the things one would point to in estimating the lossesover the long run with higher inflation.

PRELL.I think it's a reasonably balanced forecast,given my suspicion that inventory investment in the second quarter mayhave been overstated. But I wouldn't want to make too big a point ofthat. The May figures held up very well; they were raised in the\f8/16/94-4-revised figures. To date, there hasn't been any evidence there. Butwe have, in essence, carried through a slightly higher level of theinventory/sales ratio, that having been achieved in the secondquarter. We do not have a significant movement; the ratio begins totrail off very slightly in the latter part of 1995.In a sense, atthat point we are beginning to get a little improvement in final salesand we begin to see the hint of a restoration of what we think is thesecular downward trend in the overall ratio. We have anticipated inthis forecast that the adjustment in stock levels relative to salestrends is going to occur in the distribution sector, particularlyretailing. We have allowed in effect for a substantial degree ofmanufacturing inventory accumulation, which is the area where we mighthave anticipated the upside risk to have existed because of thetightening in supplies and some of the pressures on prices ofmaterials and so on. Certainly, no inventory forecast is without itsrisks, but I think in this case the balance is not distinctly on oneside or the other.

YELLEN.I agree with the central message of theGreenbook that most of the new information that has accumulated duringthe last six weeks points to continued strength in aggregate demand.\f9/27/94-30-The incoming data do not yet provide any significant evidence of asufficient slowdown in real GDP growth. However, this is not based ona great deal of evidence. A lot more data will be coming in over thenext month that will clarify whether this impression is correct ornot.I personally am concerned that we have put quite a bit ofrestraint into the pipeline, a good share of it quite recently, and itadditional 100 basis point rise in the funds rate, I am considerablymore pessimistic than the Greenbook about the 1996 forecast for realgrowth. For example, in the MPS model the impact of such a tighteningbecomes really discernible only after about four quarters, namely byearly 1996. And after eight quarters, such a rise would take about0.9 percent off real GDP. That leaves me with a sense that a forecastof 2.2 or 2.3 percent real growth in 1996 may be overly optimisticwith that added restraint.A key question now concerns the behavior of prices--whetherthere is evidence at this stage that inflation is accelerating. Thisin my view is an especially important issue given our concern withinflation as an ultimate policy goal and also the feeling that theeconomy is operating at close to potential where there is a decidedrisk that inflation could begin to creep up. But here my analysisdiffers somewhat from the staff forecast. In particular, I think weare seeing and will continue to see for a time an increase in therelative prices of raw materials and imported goods. These higherprices will feed through into the CPI for a period of time, causing atemporary increase in the rate of inflation but not a permanentincrease in the trend inflation rate, or worse yet, an acceleration ininflation.I think the increase in inflation will be temporary evenif there is only enough restraint to hold the unemployment rate at itspresent level, roughly the natural rate given staff estimates. And Ithink the markets have overreacted to the increase in producer pricesin August.Now, the Greenbook is also forecasting that consumer priceinflation will be up for the next three quarters and then will returnto roughly 3 percent by the end of 1995, and I agree with thatforecast. My difference with the Greenbook concerns whether or not aperiod of unemployment in excess of the natural rate is needed to getI think not, but the Greenbook thinks thatinflation back into line.it will require a period of unemployment in excess of the natural ratein the latter half of 1995 and 1996 to subdue inflation, and that'ssomething more than a quibble because it does govern one's view abouthow much additional restraint it is going to take to hold inflation atits present level.To elaborate just a bit, I think we are witnessing now aperfectly normal cyclical phenomenon, namely, the relative prices ofprimary commodities and raw materials tend naturally to increase withthe level of domestic and more importantly world economic activity.The prices of these materials have been increasing rapidly all year,but from initially depressed levels.I expect these prices to risefurther due to faster global growth, but then I expect them to stoprising once economic activity stabilizes. Similarly, we have had asignificant depreciation of the dollar, which is causing and willprobably continue to cause for a time a rise in the level of importprices.But the staff doesn't expect the dollar depreciation to\f-31-9/27/94continue and so we should expect import prices also to rise and thenstop rising.My conclusion is that these shocks should feed into fasterCPI inflation only for a time, and once the adjustment is complete,I expect this toinflation should revert toward its previous level.occur even if the CPI increase feeds partially through into wages,although the greater this feedback, the longer this temporary burst inI agree with Governor Kelley that there is ainflation will persist.danger that inflationary expectations can overreact. Historically, Ithink the evidence on the likely pass-through of temporary priceshocks into wages is quite inconclusive.The only caveat I want to add in this analysis is that I'massuming along with the Greenbook that the unemployment rate is notgoing to be allowed to fall below the natural rate--and that means notvery much lower than it currently is--for any significant period oftime. With respect to the question of whether or not we are below thenatural rate, I think wage behavior provides the best direct evidence.The fact that wages have been so well-behaved, with average hourlyearnings rising only 0.2 percent last month, for example, convinces methat we have not overshot the natural rate.\n","1994-09-27 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. BLINDER.it at tha.I think 1/2 percent is on track, and I'll leaveOn the forecast, largely for reasons having to do withinventories, which I brought up at the last FOMC meeting and certainlywith the staff, I would look for the third quarter to be weaker thanin the Greenbook. By pure arithmetic, some of that difference isgoing to show up in a stronger fourth quarter. So, this is not amajor disagreement. But, on balance, it leads me to a somewhat weakersecond half of 1994 than the Greenbook forecast. Conversely, I'dexpect a bit stronger first half of 1995 than the Greenbook. Notethat the projected further tightenings of monetary policy built intothe Greenbook forecast could not possibly be slowing down the economySo, whatever is in the staff forecast forin the first half of 1995.the first half of next year has to have been built in by the previoustightenings. I don't think we have tightened enough to slow theeconomy down to 1.8 percent in the first half of next year.Accordingly, I'd expect the first half of 1995 to be a bit strongerthan in the Greenbook. But over the next year there may not be muchdifference between the way I see things evolving and the way theNow, for the eight quartersGreenbook sees things evolving in total.in 1995 and 1996, the average growth rate in the Greenbook is about 2\f9/27/94-32-If wepercent.I don't find that to be a very satisfactory target.have not yet overshot capacity, and I don't believe we have althoughone can't dismiss that hypothesis completely, the economy does notneed to grow at 2 percent for two years in order to keep inflationfrom rising. If we have already overshot, then indeed we do needsomething like that.Regarding inflationary pressures, I think we should realize,in the United States right now. There are lots of stories coming outof the manufacturing core of the economy about tight markets, verystrong capacity utilization, strong order books, good sales, etc.They are all true. But they are very much concentrated in durablesmanufacturing, which in round numbers is 10 to 12 percent of valueadded in the U.S. economy. If you look at the demand side rather thanthe production side and look back at the last year, we have hadbuoyant growth over the year, which has scared a lot of people. Thefour quarters ending in the second quarter of 1994 had a growth rateof 4 percent.It's the only time that we have had a four-quarterperiod with growth as high as 4 percent in this entire businessrecovery. In previous business recoveries, one four-quarter period of4 percent would not have scared anybody and, indeed, would have leftthe FOMC thinking that things weren't looking that great.More important than the 4 percent, I want to call attentionto the fact that that growth was highly concentrated. I looked atthese numbers last night.I knew the qualitative story, but I wassurprised at the quantitative dimension. We all know where it wasconcentrated--in business fixed investment, consumer durables, andhousing. Those three sectors account for roughly 1/4 of GDP on thespending side.I'm not talking about value added weights because alot of that is imports, which is a point I'm coming to. Those threesectors of the GDP over the last four quarters registered an 11.3This means by the laws of arithmetic that thepercent rate of growth.rest of the economy, the other 75 percent, registered a 1.6 percentgrowth rate over that period.Those three sectors, of course, leavingaside housing for now, are where the price pressures are--eithercurrent or incipient.If you looked at the Greenbook forecast for thenext two quarters and took housing out of the fast-growing sector, theresult would be even more extreme. We don't expect housing to be partof the fast-growing sector going forward; the staff doesn't; none ofus do. But, leaving housing in the fast-growing sector, those threesectors in the Greenbook forecast are projected in the second half ofthis year to grow at a 6 percent rate and the rest of the economy at a1.8 percent rate.If I moved housing over the sectoral line, thatspread would be exaggerated because we are expecting a slowdown inhousing.Regarding the point that I was making about inflationarypressures, many people in popular discussions point to internationalcapacity as a safety valve on U.S. inflation. This is greatlyexaggerated because roughly 90 percent of what we consume or use isproduced at home. The place where it has the most validity, however,is exactly where the pressures are right now--in business fixedinvestment, where over 40 percent is imported, and consumer durableswhere I don't remember the fraction that is imported. Those areIt is in thisprecisely the sectors where we are seeing pressure.\f-33-9/27/94very limited part of the economy where the international safety valveis most important.Finally, I want to align myself fully with the comments JerryJordan made earlier. I have been worried for some time, and I ambecoming increasingly worried, about the disjuncture between the MainStreet view of inflation and the Wall Street view of inflation.INone of us is sure thisjust want to point out an implication:disjuncture is actually a fact; I suspect it is, as Jerry does, but itIf it is a fact, the implication is thatis hard to know for sure.real interest rates look a lot higher on Main Street than they do onWall Street, and we should be mindful of that. If that hypothesis iscorrect, that's likely to mean that there is more punch in what wehave already done than we realize. Thank you.\n","1994-09-27 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

Since March, for example,business loan growth has accelerated to an 11.1 percent rate, afterNevertheless, in my view monetary policy has shiftedfalling in 1993.toward restraint. All monetary aggregates have shown relatively weakgrowth since spring.Inventory investment has been very strong thisyear. In my view rapid inventory accumulation has been desired and islikely to continue for a time. Despite rapid inventory accumulationso far this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio has remained near thelowest level since the early 1950s. According to a recent survey byour staff, attempts in the Eighth District to build inventory,especially of finished goods, have been unsuccessful simply because ofcontinuing strong sales growth. One major motor vehicle manufacturerin the Eighth District reported that it held larger stocks than itstwo domestic competitors simply because, in contrast to its rivals, itEvenhad the capacity to keep production closer to the pace of sales.so, this firm has had difficulty in keeping its strongest sellingmodels in stock. Such observations matched the concern with respectto the nation as a whole expressed in the National Association ofPurchasing Managers surveys in October and November.In November, employment gains exceeded the robust averagemonthly increases from January to October and were more than twice aslarge as the average monthly rise in the civilian labor force.EighthDistrict unemployment fell to 4.7 percent in October, its lowest levelsince August 1974. That's a level at which we have been hovering forsome time. On a comparably measured basis, the nation's unemploymentrate has fallen to its March 1989 level, which in turn was the lowestsince December 1973.Notwithstanding this evidence of strength on the real side,the positive reaction of the bond and other financial markets inrecent weeks is heartening. I hope this means that the markets nowbelieve that the long-term inflation rate will not accelerate from itscurrent level. Whether the nearly universal expectation thatinflation over the near term, or the long term for that matter, willbe 3 percent or more is acceptable is another question, as is whetherI am not at allwe act today in terms of any short-term actions.averse to strong cyclical real growth if the thrust of our policy isconsistent with long-run price stability and we have credibility.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).The flood gate was it?\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).A less-than-successful building project.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

BROADDUS.I would think so, and I think it is certainlya very high probability that we are going to have to do somethingmore. The question before us this morning is whether or not we needto do some of that tightening today or whether we can put it off alittle longer. I think it is a very close call. My own preference atthis meeting would be to move the funds rate up 1/4 percentage pointto 5-3/4 percent. I realize the 1/4 point funds rate moves earlier inthe year had adverse reactions, and at that time some argued thatthose moves were made under sensitive circumstances. However, thesituation is very different now. We only recently made a very strongmove, so I don't think that kind of reaction would be a problem atthis stage of the game.I think the main argument for a relativelymodest further move today is that it would reinforce and lock in thequite considerable credibility gains that the November tighteningappears to have produced, as I believe John LaWare suggested. I thinksome reinforcement at this stage would be desirable given the verystrong recent data on both employment and spending. At the same time,a 1/4 point move would be significantly more restrained than any ofour last three moves, and it would indicate that we recognize the needfor caution as we move closer to the cyclical peak. So, my preferencewould be for a 1/4 percent increase.I also would like to second TomMelzer's comments about the need to consider some sort of inflationtarget, something to nail down our longer-term goals and objectives atthe February meeting.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I thinkthat we have more tightening to go, but I'm willing to wait untilearly next year. As a general matter, I agree with Governor Kelley-if you are going to do it, earlier is better. But I think we havebeen given some breathing room with the favorable CPI numbers.Itwould be useful to let us get past the end of the year and the yearend marking-to-market. That allows the markets a chance to settleout. Ultimately, I think that more tightening is going to benecessary. With all of the market and monetary restructuring that hastaken place, it is probably going to take larger swings in interestrates to achieve monetary goals.It is very difficult to generalizefrom past experience when the pipeline is going to kick in fully. Iwould like to see us give serious consideration to the longer-terminflation targeting approach that a number of people have spokenabout; Tom Melzer started off the discussion of it today. But fortoday, I think \"B\" asymmetric will serve us well.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

Ifavor \"B\" because I do think we have applied some restraint and,given the lags, I think we ought to be patient and take some time to\f12/20/94-40-see what effects, if any, they have. I favor a symmetric directivefor several reasons. Part of it is my normal antipathy to, ordiscomfort with, asymmetric directives. But more fundamentally onthis occasion, I have trouble imagining what evidence we will get inthe next several weeks that is really going to help us address what Iconsider to be one of the key questions: What is the economy going tobe like and what is the appropriate stance or policy actions that willinfluence things later in 1995 and into 1996? It just doesn't seemlikely to me that we are going to learn anything in the next severalweeks that is going to help us very much in addressing thosequestions. I may be wrong, but we can have a conference call ifsignificant new information does materialize. Beyond that, thesuggestion has been made, and I certainly agree with it, that thereare a number of fundamental longer-run policy issues that theCommittee should discuss and perhaps try to reach consensus on. Inoted a number of them in my recent communication.

If we have thepossibility of concurring statements, we are going to invite more thanwe might like.

PRELL.I think we went through this last time, and Iwon't repeat the four-part harmony answer on the 1994 error. In asense, we were thrown off by some movements in the numbers in 1993that caused us to hesitate to follow the model religiously. Lookingback over the past year--as you noted and we noted in the Greenbook-the behavior of prices is not out of line with the model forecast overthe past couple of years on the assumption of a NAIRU in the 6 percentarea. The behavior of compensation, including the latest reading,might on balance be a bit more favorable--too high in 1993 relative tothe model and on the low side in 1994--and that perhaps raises somequestion, but it is still within the confidence interval. At thisare well in line with conventional short-run Phillips curve analyses.We run many different models and we get different answers, and I thinkthis is a reasonable ballpark estimate of what the history embodied inthese models would suggest is likely to happen in 1995 on theassumption that we get this kind of employment data.\n","1995-02-01 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I will tell you one smallelement of this, however--or give you my position. With respect tothe International Monetary Fund, we are in a somewhat similarposition, though on a slightly different scale, as we are relative tothe Congress. The International Monetary Fund got itself into thissituation essentially in December. They realized that they knew lessabout what was going on in Mexico than we did. We knew a great dealless than we wished we had known, even though we had devoted aconsiderable amount of resources to this on a daily basis for at leastthe last year. What the IMF does know is that Peter Fisher and hiscolleagues as well as people here at the Board have much bettercontacts and information about the day-to-day operations in Mexicothan the Fund has. That is for two reasons:First of all, the Fund,for better or worse, does not have a culture that is designed tofollow day-to-day developments in the individual economies of membernations. Secondly, on the other side, the Mexicans are worldchampions in terms of obfuscating about economic information whilesimultaneously providing a lot of other information. Transparency ofthe way economic policy is conducted in Mexico, including monetarypolicy, is a very serious problem, and it is one that relates to thecomment earlier about the functioning of financial markets as well ascomments--what Governor Lindsey was asking about yesterday--concerningthe balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico from top to bottom.\f1/31-2/1/95-140-To extend Chairman Greenspan's analogy a step further--maybeI am taking it a step back--once we have put the house fire out, wewant to build a more fire-proof house and we want to try to encouragethe resident of the house to stop smoking or at least to stop smokingin bed. I think we have an interest in getting it done, not that weare going to create a mistake-proof economic environment in Mexico anymore than we can create a mistake-proof economic environment in theUnited States. We can hope that with some effort and a considerableexpenditure of Federal Reserve resources--I mean human resources andbudgetary resources in one sense--to fix things so that at least wewill not have these problems coming back.Let me come back to another point on resources.I share, forall the reasons Governor Blinder has stated, the concerns about whatwe will monitor and how we will monitor because this will have, amongother things, resource implications for the Federal Reserve System. Iwant to know whether I am going to have to budget one man year orforty-two man years to get this job done right. We need to know atthe minimum what we are going to be asked to do, and see whether it isfeasible to do it both in terms of resources and, as Governor Lindseyand the Chairman have said, in terms of the intellectual feasibility.\n","1995-02-01 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

JORDAN.So you have nominal spending rising at a rate ofless than 5 percent for eight quarters and pretty much a flat patternthrough 1996.It's not much different from the last severalGreenbooks except that at least it's flat now whereas before itdropped this year and rose later.So, to decompose nominal spendinginto its parts, you have real output rising a little less than 2-1/2percent on average and prices also rising a little less than 2-1/2percent, using the deflator anyway, to give you that nominal spending.Yet, you have a structure of interest rates in which rates are 6percent and higher throughout the yield curve for the whole eightquarter period. I look at that and say I don't know whether it's agood forecast or a bad forecast.I certainly don't have a differentone to propose, but in the sense of a \"reasonableness\" check, should Iexpect nominal interest rates to be in the 6 to 7 percent range whilenominal spending is under 5 percent for a two-year period?Comment?\n","1995-03-28 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. PRELL.If you are asking whether the relationship ofnominal interest rates to nominal growth looks abnormal orunreasonable here, I would say that there is not a very strongregularity in the history of the relationship between nominal interestrates and nominal GDP growth.We have played around with someeconometric exercises to see whether there is any information to begained by looking at that spread as an index of restraint andprospective real economic activity.It is weak.It can contribute alittle to explaining the prospects.I don't feel uncomfortable withthis forecast.I think the fact that the nominal interest rate is alittle higher than nominal GDP growth is consistent with our sensethat this is putting some drag on economic activity, just as the factthat the real short-term rate, a bit above historical averages as weperceive it, could be interpreted as being consistent with some modestmonetary restraint on top of what we believe to be some moderatefiscal restraint.That is very hard to say.The real rate ofinterest could vary considerably over a cycle or even a little longer.\n","1995-03-28 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

We haveinterpreted monetary policy per se as probably modestly restrictive atthis point. That is, the real rate of interest is perhaps somewhatabove the natural rate. But, in the total financial picture, we alsorecognize that credit availability if anything has been improving; theterms and standards of bank loans have been moving in an easingdirection; and we also have had an impulse through the exchangethat is tending to be stimulative over this period.

We may have a moderately tight monetary policy, butthat is appropriate in view of the tremendous stimulus that took placein 1991 through 1993.The other comment I would make, and we heardsome commentary on this issue today, is that any reaction to fiscalpolicy restraint, certainly any reaction to the prospect of it, isvery dangerous.

PRELL.I should emphasize that, given our limitedability to predict these relationships, the calibration of this isclearly very uncertain. I think the point of Tom's presentation here,which is a schematic one in a sense, is simply that if there are largeanticipatory reactions in the bond market, then you do not need tomove the short rate as aggressively in order to give a greaterstimulus to private investment spending. It's a simple point, and wedon't want to suggest by the precision of these charts that we cancalibrate that very neatly. Again, it's a broad conceptual issue andone that, obviously, I would think you folks would want to contemplatein thinking about where funds rates might be over time.\n","1995-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. BROADDUS.President Broaddus.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I would like to takejust a couple of extra minutes tomorrow when we talk about the longerterm strategy of policy, so I'll try to make these economic commentsthis afternoon as brief as I can.As our Beigebook report indicated, our three latest monthlymail surveys of retail, service sector, and manufacturing activity allindicated somewhat slower growth in these key sectors in our region inthe tone of the anecdotal comments at our June board meeting, at whichwe invite not only the Richmond directors but also our Charlotte andBaltimore branch directors, somewhat more bullish and at least mildlyencouraging. On the whole, I would say they suggested that businessactivity in our District may be bottoming out and getting poised for abit of a revival going forward. Our regional anecdotal tidbit of themonth is that the recent closing of Pennsylvania Avenue is going tocost the D.C. Government about $3/4 million in parking meter fees.Idon't know what that implies for the fund rate, but that's a fact forwhatever it's worth.Regarding the national picture, as I think I have mentionedbefore, we use a VAR model in developing our Humphrey-Hawkinsprojections and this time our projections are very close to theGreenbook's except for inflation; we are on the high side there. Weare showing about 1/2 percentage point more CPI inflation in both 1995and 1996--to be specific, 3.5 percent for 1995, which I think is theupper limit of the estimates you received from the members, Mike, and3.3 percent for 1996.Even allowing for the rising inflation in ourforecast, I would say that both the Greenbook projections and ourprojections in a sense are pretty rosy, at least from here on out.They both say that real growth hit its low point and inflation hit itshigh point in the second quarter, and they both project rising outputand employment and generally declining inflation going forward.Frankly, this gives me a little pause since, as we all know, rosyIn general, along with my staff, Iscenarios often don't play out.still think the risks are pretty well balanced, but I have to confessIthat I am still worried about the downside risks on the real side.think the recent weakness in employment and income growth could feedback into spending. Moreover, a slowing economy is always morevulnerable to downside risks, and I think Bill McDonough's commentsabout the downside risks in the external sector are reasonably welltaken. Against that background, I very much hope that the Juneemployment report is a little brighter than the last two.One final comment I would make on the financial side--I thinkthe 15 basis point jump in the long bond rate in response to that newhomes sales report in May was remarkable. It was, to be sure, a verylarge jump. But this is a series that everybody knows is unusuallyvolatile and it usually does not get anything like that kind ofreaction in bond markets. I think that reaction indicates how supersensitive even the longest-term inflation expectations are to\f-19-7/5-6/95relatively small bits of information. That suggests to me that weneed to provide a firmer anchor for these longer-term expectations andI'd like to come back to that tomorrow if I may.\n","1995-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I think part of it has to do with our not really knowingwhether the ranges are something we should be shooting for--whetherthey are long-term objectives, or whether they are in effect shortterm monitoring ranges to be explained. So, I support the notion ofhaving a more extended discussion of what our goals should be in termsof thinking about restructuring the Humphrey-Hawkins statute and thekinds of things we monitor. I don't think this is the time to do it,because I am not sure we know enough now about what range we shouldmonitor, whether it should be M2 or M3 or something else. At thispoint, I certainly agree with the notion that if we change the M2range now, we are going to draw more attention to it.But at somepoint I think we do need to address the kinds of issues that AlBroaddus has raised and decide whether or not we are going to supportlegislative changes that would get us off the horns of this dilemma.\n","1995-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

Thatkind of nervousness has been underscored by Tom Hoenig and someothers. There seems to be a feeling--calling it a consensus may betoo strong a characterization--that we can be fairly confident thatinflation has reached a cyclical peak. The probability of that iscertainly higher than I would have expected a while back, but I thinkwe need to keep a longer-term perspective here. It was less than ayear and an half ago that we ended an extended period of substantialmonetary ease. While the risk of further inflation in this cycle issmaller than it was, I don't think it is zero and we need to keep thatin mind. I think a cautious approach involving a quarter-pointreduction in the funds rate is the appropriate degree of easing now.As MikeI would oppose a half-point reduction. One other comment:Moskow and others have said, it is important in communicating thisaction to the public to make clear that it is done in the context of acontinuing longer-term commitment to price stability. I would verymuch like to see the words \"price stability\" in the announcement thatwe will make this afternoon if we take this action.

One stems from an inquirythat we had just this week from a bank in our District. My sense isthat knowledge of this is spreading like wildfire through the bankingindustry, and I think banks are looking to the Fed to take someposition on this; they are asking whether the practice is legal and soforth. I presume somebody is out there peddling the idea, or thesoftware that supports it, or whatever. So, one question would bewhat can be said about these arrangements and maybe this discussionshould be continued later at lunch if that is more appropriate. Myother question is whether we have the capability to publish data that,without violating any confidences in terms of individual institutiondata, would give the public a better handle on what is going on.Clearly, some people are misinterpreting the stance of monetary policybecause they don't have this information.\n","1995-09-26 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

BROADDUS.I am still thinking of it in terms of those1987 figures and that would be a much, much stronger performance thanI think anyone was expecting back last summer. Given that, I think akey question at this point is whether that much stronger quarterlygain will be followed by another stronger-than-anticipated performancein the current quarter. Not many people seem to expect that. Ofcourse, the staff revised its 2.6 percent growth projection for thecurrent quarter down to 1.9 percent in the current Greenbook. But theGreenbook also suggests that there is plenty of upside risk in thatprojection, even though that risk is not getting much attention thesedays, and Mike underlined that very eloquently in his comments thismorning. In particular, as Mike said, production-worker hours havebeen growing at a healthy pace lately. The staff is projecting hoursto be up at over a 2-1/2 percent annual rate this quarter. So, even avery small quarterly increase in productivity could on the old basisgive us a growth rate in the current quarter of 3 percent at an annualrate or even higher. We have the very real possibility, it seems tome, of two consecutive relatively strong quarters despite all thepessimistic economic commentary we read about. With the economyalready operating at least in the neighborhood of potential GDP, itseems to me that that should be a source of some concern.The bottom line is that there is considerable room forforecast error on either side of the staff's 1.9 percent projectionfor the current quarter. From a policymaking perspective, the picturehopefully should become considerably clearer once we have some of thedata for the month of December. We will be getting that informationnot too many days down the road.One final comment:It disturbs me a little that the staff isstill projecting an essentially flat 3 percent inflation rate throughthe forecast horizon ending in 1997.I am not questioning theprojection. I am just stating that I don't like it very much. Since3 percent is such a mild rate compared to our experience over the last15-20 years, I think a lot of people--not around this table--areprobably fairly comfortable with that scenario. But it's worth\f-16-12/19/95remembering, if I have calculated this right, that at a 3 percentannual inflation rate the price level doubles in something like 23-1/2or 24 years. Moreover, a reasonable confidence interval around a 3percent point forecast would certainly include at least a 3-1/2percent rate of inflation, maybe something more than that. That's notprice stability. I don't think we should be satisfied with it.Inthat regard, Mr. Chairman, we talked in July about the possibility ofadding a longer-term inflation objective to our monetary aggregateI wouldtargets to make our longer-term strategy more meaningful.hope that we might have an opportunity to resume or reopen thatdiscussion when we look at longer-term issues at the next meeting.\n","1995-12-19 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

If you look at the actual pattern offorward rates, going from overnight out to a couple of years, whathappens is that if the long-term rate moves the way you said, theother rates move back up.

You made reference to slight declines in longer-term interestrates; you used the 10-year rate in the chart. As I think about yourforecast for the next six months, I ask myself what is going to happenafter real GDP decelerates from an indicated growth rate of around 4percent in the second quarter to rates in your forecast of 2.3 and 1.9percent in the third and fourth quarters; the monthly average for theCPI is an increase of .2 percent for the remaining seven months of theyear; housing starts drop from the 1.46 - 1.47 million area; motorvehicle sales and production drop from a rate of over 15 million unitsto something below that; and job growth slows to increases of only100,000 a month in the final three months of the year.

I agree with Ed Boehne that itwould be useful to state our goal in terms of maximum sustainablegrowth and the notion of trying to achieve price stability. It seemsto me that while we can set 2 percent or maybe something else as aninflation goal, I am a little skeptical that any one measure ofinflation is the right one. At any point in time, I can imagine thatthere will be problems with a particular measure, as there are nowwith the CPI. Intuitively, I am attracted to the notion of the GDPdeflator, but I will admit that it too may have problems at times.There may be unusual circumstances affecting the various measures, soI am hesitant to pin down a particular number.

BOEHNE.President Boehne.The future usually bears some resemblance to thepast, but the future is almost always different from the past. Ithink we are in one of those situations now where we do not know howmuch different the future will be. I believe most of us feel as wetalk to people in our Districts that it may be more different, atleast for a while, than we have become accustomed to. That higherdegree of uncertainty ought to make us more cautious about takingsteps at this meeting, and I feel very comfortable about keepingpolicy the same.Looking ahead, clearly the case for tightening and theprobability that we will have to tighten in the coming months would befairly high under the old model. That may indeed turn out to be thecase. On the other hand, it may not turn out to be the case becausewe may be able to remain on an unchanged policy course longer than wenow anticipate under these conditions without accelerating inflation.So, while I am prepared to support an asymmetric directive, it doesnot automatically mean in my mind that we are setting ourselves up fora tightening. That may indeed be necessary, and I think we need to bewatchful. Should conditions arise where we have to tighten, I thinkwe ought to do so and we ought to be decisive about it. But I do notknow when that tightening will need to occur, whether it will be nextmonth, the month after, or six months down the line. For today, Iagree that we should make no change in policy, be very watchful, andkeep an open mind as to what we ought to do at the next and subsequentmeetings.\n","1996-07-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

The first has to do with what Iwould call the dual purposes here, which is concern about withdrawalfrom the world versus a domestic political consideration. As somemembers have emphasized in this discussion, there certainly will comea time in the future when we will wish to be in a position tointervene in foreign exchange markets. I am sure that will happen.We have managed to intervene in foreign exchange markets quite a bit.I can't think of any instance since I have been here when we reallyhad to intervene. It certainly was not because of an emergency or afinancial crisis. As I recall, every time we intervened the reasonreally came down to what was in effect a domestic politicalconsideration. Some major trading partner had too high a currency ortoo low a currency or something of that nature and that was the realmotivation. It was not a systemic risk situation. There was noquestion about systemic risk. In every instance that we can think of,except perhaps for some hypothetical developments in the future, weknow why intervention is being used. It has nothing to do withsystemic risk; it is an arm of the domestic political apparatus, and Ido not like that. I do not think that is what we are here for, and Ithink there are risks to this institution if we play that game.We really have to think about two issues. The first, as hasbeen mentioned, is the list of countries with which we want to conductthese transactions, and related to that is the question of whether ornot the other currency is a major store of value. Mr. Chairman, youindicated that we should exclude countries where the State Departmentdoes not want U.S. citizens to travel. I do not think we need arepurchase agreement with North Korea or Cuba, and I do not know whereelse we cannot travel, so I think that is too small a list of excludedcountries.\n","1996-07-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

BOEHNE.President Boehne.The economy in the Philadelphia District appearsto be on a modest uptrend that has tilted down from a somewhat fasterpace earlier in the year. Manufacturing is growing but at a somewhatslower pace. Delivery times, while lengthening in the spring, haveshortened more recently. Retail sales growth, quite healthy in thespring, has eased during the summer months. Nonresidentialconstruction is flat and the pickup in residential constructionappears to be decelerating. Employment growth is improving slightlyand some labor markets are tight while others still have slack. Priceand wage pressures on the whole still seem to be reasonably containedin the District.Turning to the nation, at the last meeting in early July wehoped that more information would help settle two questions--whethergrowth would moderate to a more sustainable pace and whether wageinflation indeed is beginning to accelerate. On the sustainablegrowth question, I think the bottom line is that the weight of thedata suggests a moderating growth trend but how much moderation is farfrom clear. On the wage question, the larger first-quarter gain wasrepeated in the second. Once again, however, sizable wage gains wereoffset by a small rise in benefit costs so that total compensation has\f-19-8/20/96been rising at essentially the same rate in 1996 as in 1995. On thewhole, price pressures remain remarkably subdued for this stage of anexpansion. Reasonable people can easily come to different conclusionsabout the outlook at this point. My hunch is that we may seeappreciable slowing in growth because of subdued personal consumption,more modest growth in business fixed investment, and some slackeningin residential construction. At the same time, upward wage pressureswill not likely bubble up into upward price pressures as much as onemight think because of continuing offsetting smaller benefit costs andstrong competition for products and services. Nonetheless, in thisenvironment I think we need to continue to monitor demand and pricepressures very closely.\n","1996-08-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

Now, it may be that the experience of the last 8 to 10quarters is a signal that the economy is changing. But we arestarting to see wage pressures and we are starting to see a flatteningout, if not an upturn, in most of the broad measures of inflation. Inthis environment, I do not think we can be quite as sanguine as manyhave suggested. I think we need to be very humble about our forecastsof the GDP slowdown being enough to guide this rather large andcumbersome plane totally on instruments without human intervention, atleast at this point in time. I think we need a course correction. Ithink we need to step in and start steering this economy a little bit.Now, it seems to me that if, in the expectation that the expansionwould be slower, we adjusted policy in 25 basis point increments, thenwe could start to steer it against an upside threat in smallincrements as well. It might be that the markets will overreact, butI think that overreaction would be short-lived. I do not necessarilybelieve that they would think we are all knowing because many of themhave seen the same trends that we see in some of the data. I amconscious of the fact that a lot of what we are getting from therather than how they think we should react. If some uptick in thethem back up to perhaps where they were earlier in the year, thatmight be helpful in restraining some of the possible sources ofovershooting that might be in the GDP forecast.So, I would agree with those who recommended a coursecorrection at this point. I could go with 25 basis points.\n","1996-08-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

In addition, I have a feeling that we are going to haveupward revisions in that area. We have had such revisions in the lastcouple of years because the survey does not take into account, as wellas it should, hiring by new businesses. There was a big upwardadjustment when the last revision was made, and I would expect to seeanother.

BROADDUS.I am not ready to do that.In a veryimportant sense, and this is really the main point I want to make, Ithink we still have some distance to go before we can be comfortablethat we have achieved price stability in the way we have defined it.The old Neal Resolution language, which we endorsed, defines pricestability as a condition where expectations of future inflation do notplay a significant role in economic decision-making. I think one ofthe best indicators of inflation expectations is the long-term bondrate. That rate averaged around 3-1/2 percent in the late 1950s andabout 4 percent in the early 1960s when the CPI inflation rate was ina range of 1/2 percent to 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate. Today thelong-term bond rate is at 6-1/2 percent, about the midpoint of itsrecent range between a little below 6 percent and a little over 7percent. There is not a lot of reason to think that the real longterm bond rate is much different now than it was in the earlier periodwhen it appeared to average around 3 percent. That seems to begenerally consistent with the surveys depicted in the Bluebook, whichsuggest that long-term inflation expectations are still on the orderof 3-1/2 percent today. Alternatively, if we compare nominal rates inthe earlier period with nominal rates today and attribute most of thedifference to inflation expectations between the two periods, theimplication would be that inflation expectations are anywhere from 21/2 to 3 percentage points higher today than they were in the late1950s and early 1960s. Beyond that, the volatility of bond rates is alot greater than it was in the earlier period and that volatilityalmost certainly reflects, at least to some extent, more volatileinflation expectations.So, Mr. Chairman, I would conclude that we are still somedistance from achieving price stability in the Neal Resolution sense,and I think we need to remain vigilant going forward.\n","1996-12-17 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. BOEHNE.I am reassured that President Broaddus isstanding firm in his commitment to price stability. I was gettingworried about that!The Philadelphia region continues on a modest growth trend,with most sectors reflecting this trend. Attitudes are positive andthe outlook is generally positive as well.Labor markets aregenerally snug, although places like the southern-most part of NewJersey and parts of Pennsylvania still have relatively highunemployment rates. Getting \"qualified workers\" is becoming anincreasingly familiar refrain among business people. It is somethingthat one hears almost regularly. Average wage increases, however,still remain in the 3 to 4 percent area, although I think theyprobably are concentrated more in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range.Almost everyone trying to sell something, from large businesses tostreet vendors, still reports stiff competition, which tempers thetendency to raise prices in this kind of environment.There is not much to be added on the national economy. Ithink the key points are that the economy appears to have successfullymade the adjustment downward from unsustainable growth rates earlier;it appears to be on a more sustainable track, and I think that is the\f-20-12/17/96outlook. On inflation, we are still operating in a cautionary zone.Performance is better, actually remarkably better, than one might haveexpected on the basis of historical experience. So, we are doingreasonably well there and are generally looking at a positive, evenenviable, position to be in. As has been pointed out, there areworries and potential problems, and we need to stay alert. But we canalso continue to be patient.\n","1996-12-17 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. MEYER.The limited amount of data that we now haveavailable since the last meeting does not alter the picture of theeconomy, and that picture is a remarkably good one.Economic growthhas now slowed to trend. I read core measures of inflation as stableto still declining. The unemployment rate remains locked in a low butnarrow band. Still, I think we all appreciate that good monetarypolicy is forward-looking. So, the relevant question is, what changecan we look forward to with enough confidence to justify a change inpolicy today?Given that we are beginning from full employment, onejustification for a policy change would be a strong conviction thatgrowth over the forecast horizon will be persistently above or belowtrend. But the risks related to growth have really become morebalanced over the last several months.The Greenbook forecastindicates trend growth immediately ahead. The discussion around thetable suggests that few of us have a conviction that would justify avery different forecast. I compared the Greenbook forecast to five ofmy favorite private-sector forecasts, and the range is remarkablytight. On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, the range fornext year is from a low of 2.0 percent to a high of 2.4 percent. Thisis a very narrow range. Unemployment rates tend to be slightly higherthan in the staff forecast; they jump off from about 5.4 percent,which is the current rate, rather than the lower 5.2 percent rate inthe Greenbook, but again these forecasts are in a very narrow rangethat pretty much encompasses the estimates of trend growth.When we begin from trend growth, I think one thing that wemight also recognize is that slight differences in the forecast forGDP growth, differences that are much smaller than the margin offorecast error, produce qualitatively different forecasts. A forecastof slightly slower GDP growth at the lower limit of that range, like 2percent, produces rising unemployment rates, as in the consensus BlueChip forecast, whereas a slightly higher forecast of GDP growthproduces a degree of further tightness in the economy and furtherrisks of rising inflation that none of us views as acceptable.\f-28-12/17/96A second justification for policy change would be theconviction that we are already below NAIRU and not likely to move backto it quickly enough to prevent an uptick in inflation. This isbasically the staff forecast, and my view has been and continues to bethat this is the most serious risk factor in the outlook. Yet, we getstuck in place because we continue to be confronted by the reality ofstable to declining core inflation in the face of this prevailing lowunemployment rate. So, we wait for additional data to resolve ourdoubts. The risk of waiting, judging from the modest rise ininflation in the staff forecast, is not very great. Still, it isprobably worthwhile noting that in all of the five private-sectorforecasts that I looked at, there are increases in core inflation overThat is a pervasive tendency that just aboutthe next year or two.everybody is worried about.I think we need to keep that in mind.Just a little historical perspective: I think the majorthreat to an expansion comes from an ultimate overshooting of demandrelative to productive capacity and from the resulting acceleration ofinflation. I do not believe that business cycles are dead. Rather, Ithink there has been a coincidence of events that so far havepermitted us to avoid pervasive excess demand and rising pricepressures.I want to suggest a few of them that we have not discussedvery much. Demand is always chasing supply during the expansion, butI think supply has been more elusive than normal in this particularcycle.Effective labor supply has been increased by an apparentfalling NAIRU. In addition, we have had very strong capital spendingin this expansion, and as a result we have seen very rapid growth inindustrial capacity. So, if we look at the price pressures in theproduct markets, they seem even better contained than the priceI think that is an importantpressures in the labor markets.distinction. One reason why this absence of pricing leverage makessense is a lack of excess demand pressure in the product markets thatmakes firms more cautious about raising wages in response to laborincreases that do occur. Other factors that have inhibited the normalbuoyancy in demand at this stage in the cycle have been the continuingfiscal restraint and the persistent drag from net exports.So, supplyhas been increasing more rapidly perhaps than normal, demand has beenless buoyant, and that is what has created the current environment.But as I said, the business cycle is not dead; historysuggests that the risks are tilted in favor of demand ultimatelyovershooting productive capacity and causing higher inflation. Whilethis should not prevent us from enjoying the current balancedprosperity and good performance, it does suggest vigilance rather thancomplacency as we move into 1997.\n","1996-12-17 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

JORDAN.saidthat every day people ask him to find them a deal so they can put their money to work. But forbalance,who says that everybody already has as much money as theyneed so that the bank cannot find any more borrowers because there are too many lenders. Heconstantly argues that we should lower interest rates so the business firms will be more willing toborrow and produce more to catch up with demand; otherwise, we are going to have inflation.[Laughter] This leads me to be concerned about how directors are selected. [Laughter]A theme among other bankers around the District is that lending is being driven byasset assessments and not at all by cash flows or concerns about future cash flows. Bankerscomplain a lot that pension funds and insurance companies are doing deals that no sensible bankerwould be willing to consider. They indicate that income properties such as hotels, motels, stripmall outlets, all kinds of outlet stores, restaurants, and auto parts stores are having problems. Theturnover in such existing income properties is occurring at prices that these bankers see asquestionable. In Zanesville, Ohio, for instance, they reported that three of the five new auto partsstores that were built last year already were closed in the first quarter of this year. I guess thecapitalist system is working in a certain sense. Losses are being incurred.Another frequent complaint has been the Federal Farm Credit Banks. One bankersaid he lost 15 percent of his ag portfolio in the first quarter of this year alone to the Federal FarmCredit Banks. That caused another banker to say that they decided to get completely out of aglending because they could not compete on equal terms with the Federal Farm Credit Banks.One banker asserted that when he talks to customers about borrowing more, they areunwilling to consider the possibility of a rise in interest rates in the future. They believe that theeconomy is in a permanently low interest rate environment. To his frustration, when he tells them\f5/19/98that they have to allow for the possibility that interest rates could go up, they just dismiss thethought as being unrealistic because the economy has entered a new era. So, he argues that even avery small interest rate increase would have a significant sobering effect on acquisition prices thatare being paid. Another banker commented that all of his customers are bankrupt; they just will notknow it until interest rates go up.In manufacturing, directors have cited numerous examples of acquisition prices thatthey think are too high. For example,equipment business said that he is seeing acquisition prices worldwide that he thinks are out ofsight. In retailing, Dillard Department Stores bought Mercantile Stores on Monday of this week.When the CEO of Mercantile Stores, who is on my Cleveland board, called me over the weekend,he simply said that heapproved itfor his shareholders. That was the best he could say about the transaction.We heard more reports of sharp price increases in farmlands. One that I thoughtwould be of special interest to Don Kohn is that while we were in Wooster, Ohio, we heard thatover the course of the past year over 50 Amish families have sold raw land and moved to aneighboring county. They told us that farmlands that were going for $2,000 to $2,500 per acre ayear ago are now being sold for over $4,000 an acre.As an example of the tightness of labor markets, one banker said that whenever hesees a customer talking to a teller for more than a minute or two, it turns out that the teller is gettinga job offer. [Laughter]With respect to construction, one director said that this spring he has seen moreannouncements of new projects of every type than he has ever seen in the region before. Thisdirector is an official of a building and construction labor union. The surge in new projects may be\f5/19/98reflective of the mild winter and early spring. In any event he sees announcements of new projectsinvolving water, sewer, transportation and auto plants, hospitals, schools, road construction, andhotels all over the District. In Newark, Ohio, three new hotel projects have been announced bymajor chains, financed by institutional investors. So, we will have plenty of hotels in Newark.As others have noted, there are numerous reports of health care cost increases. Themost extreme that I have heard involves Pennsylvania Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which isrequesting a 30 percent increase this year.Turning to the national situation, over 25 years ago Leonid Brezhnev said that thefundamental problem we faced was that we can only distribute and consume what we actuallyproduce, and he felt that a capitalist plot was involved. But we do face that problem. How muchdemand is out there, what is fostering all of this demand, and what is the probability that we aregoing to have adequate aggregate supply to keep up with all of it? A year ago, I was hearingreports of good economic conditions, but also about the need to be cautious about taking risks.Now I only hear reports about good economic conditions. People's expectations about returns thatare available to them on a variety of investments clearly have risen very sharply, whether it is director indirect, in the equity markets, in residential and commercial income properties, and in varioustypes of new business ventures. So, in a relative sense, they view the costs of borrowing funds forinvesting as having gone down compared to what they can get on more secure long-term financialinstruments like Treasuries. I thought that Al Broaddus' initial analysis on this point was correct.We have all become accustomed to repeating the Chairman's way of phrasing theobjective of our policy and its success as being inflation that is so low that people do not even thinkabout it. In that sense, we have been meeting that criterion in terms of output prices. But acorollary also has to be that we do not see people making decisions based on the assumption that\f5/19/98asset prices will rise forever relative to output prices. In that sense, we are not meeting thecriterion, and we are not being successful. We all know that asset prices cannot rise foreverrelative to output prices or income streams. So, the good news is that this too will end. Thequestion is how and when. Over the last two years through the first four months of this year, I haveseen that not only is demand for output from households and businesses very strong, but it also iscontinuing to accelerate. I believe such demand is being fostered by excessive growth of moneyand bank credit and we see a lot of evidence that supports that argument. We need to see thatgrowth in demand slow down. It is not a question to me of no change or a small change in thestance of current monetary policy in terms of the interbank overnight rate. It is a question of asmall change now or a much bigger change later on.\n","1998-05-19 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  END OF MEETING\n","1998-05-19 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).

PRELL.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will start the presentation. We willbe referring to the package of charts entitled “Staff Presentation on the EconomicOutlook,” which may be at the bottom of the pile of papers in front of you. 2/Chart 1 provides a basic summary of the staff economic forecast. Asyou know, the BEA published its advance estimate of fourth-quarter GDPon Friday; it was a half point above our 5 percent guess. However, giventhat the BEA numbers do not really point us in a different direction--andthey are only tentative, in any event--we have stuck with the Greenbookfigures for our presentation today.The top panels of the chart show our projection for real GDP, on afour-quarter percent change basis. We are looking for a substantial2/ A copy of the material used by the staff is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 2)\f2/2-3/9921report--to around 2½ percent this year and next. As the bars in the leftpanel indicate, the slowing is entirely accounted for by domestic spending:The negative contribution from net exports is expected to diminishconsiderably over the forecast period.Though the growth of output is much slower, it is pretty close to ourestimate of the trend rate for potential, so that the unemployment rate--thered line in the middle panel--changes little from where it was last quarter.The chart also shows the movements in the factory utilization rate. Overthe past year, we observed the odd pattern of the plant utilization ratedropping somewhat below its long-term average even as the jobless ratewas reaching a 28-year low. We are anticipating that these indicators ofsupply pressures will continue to send conflicting messages, each of themchanging little on net over the next two years.As Dave will be discussing later, we have given greater weight to thelabor market tautness in arriving at the inflation forecast shown in thebottom panel. We foresee a noticeable pickup in the pace of price increaseover the next two years--about a percentage point as measured either bythe CPI or by the GDP chain index.Chart 2 presents some of the financial backdrop for this projection.The basic assumption is that the federal funds rate will be unchangedthrough next year. As you can see in the top panel, given our forecast ofrising inflation, this implies a further decline in the real funds rate-­proxied by the nominal rate minus the recent inflation rate. In fact, it isnot at all clear that inflation expectations have come down as far as actualinflation in the past year, so this measure may overstate the current levelof the real rate--and consequently may exaggerate the decline that liesahead. But I would characterize our forecast as incorporating a real shortterm interest rate that is at the low end of the range since 1995.The real short rate is scarcely an unambiguous or comprehensive gaugeof the financial impetus to demand, so it is worthwhile to look at a fewother indicators of credit market conditions. The picture is mixed. In themiddle left panel, you can see that nominal yields on Treasury andinvestment grade corporate bonds have fallen over the past couple ofyears--probably by more than longer-term inflation expectations. Junkbond yields also eased a bit until the market was jolted by the Russiandefault shock last summer. The junk rate index plotted here is now uproughly 1½ percentage points from a year ago, suggesting that the typicallow grade firm is facing a considerably increased long-term borrowingcost.The senior loan officer survey--the basis of the right panel--indicatesthat businesses also are facing a little less friendly reception at commercial\f2/2-3/9922banks, with loan underwriting standards having been tightened some inrecent months, especially in the case of larger firms.Credit has not dried up, however, as may be seen in the bottom panel,which plots the real debt growth of households and businesses combined.Through the fourth quarter, the end of the solid portion of the line, debtgrowth remained rapid. We are forecasting a moderation, but this isscarcely a credit-crunch scenario--as might have been feared for a whilelast fall. Lenders have turned a bit more cautious, but most of theexplanation for the projected slackening in debt expansion comes from thedemand side.If there are corresponding signs of increased caution in equity markets,they are rather difficult to find. Share prices have continued to soar, andwhere they are headed from here clearly is a crucial question for theeconomic outlook. The top panels of Chart 3 don’t answer that question,but they provide some provocative perspective by comparing theperformance of the U.S. stock market in the 1990s with a couple of otherimpressive bull markets of yesteryear--Japan in the 1980s and Wall Streetin the 1920s. Given the amount of artistry involved in choosing the baseperiods and thus aligning these curves, I would recommend taking thepictures with at least a grain of salt. But, if you have a taste for salt,perhaps they are suggestive of some of the risks confronting us.The middle panels come at the issue from an angle that is perhaps a bitmore analytical. At the left, I have repeated an exhibit I’ve used in priorpresentations to demonstrate why share prices had to peak soon. Perhapsyou should stop me before I do it again! [Laughter] The latestobservations are rough approximations, given yesterday’s prices and ourestimates of earnings through year-end. The S&P 500’s aggregate P/E isat an unprecedented level. And, to underscore the abnormality, it hasachieved this multiple not when earnings had a cyclical upturn in front ofthem but rather, as you can see in the bottom left panel, when the profitshare of GNP has risen to a multi-decade high. And, if the S&P multiple isremarkable, that for the NASDAQ composite--at the right--is astonishing,moving rapidly toward triple digits!Although some analysts would say--indeed, have said--that earningsare beside the point in valuing stocks in this New Era, we have not beenable to break the habit of looking at them--which may help to explain ourforecast errors. I have shown, in the bottom right panel, annual percentchanges in NIPA corporate profits--the black line--along with those forS&P 500 earnings per share. The accounting concepts and coverage of thetwo series differ, but they have tended to move together. In that light, thedivergence between our forecast of NIPA profits in 1999 and the S&Ppredictions of Wall Street strategists is worth noting. It suggests that the\f2/2-3/9923months ahead. If we had an adequate sample of the Wall Streetexpectations for 2000, I suspect that the story would be reinforced. Suchdisappointments have not stopped the market to date, but we haveassumed that--from such high valuations--it will be difficult to extend theuptrend in prices.If we prove to be anywhere close to right about the trend from here, thecouple of years. Chart 4 summarizes some of the key considerations inour forecast for domestic demand. Because these are familiar stories,I shall just run through the list very quickly.The upper left panel highlights the fact that though we have the wealthincome ratio declining, the lags in the effects on spending lead us toexpect that consumer outlays will continue to grow faster than income fora while longer, pushing the saving rate still lower. But spending growthdoes moderate.In the housing market--depicted at the right--we expect that withmortgage rates remaining near current levels, the monthly payment burdenof home-ownership will remain attractively low. This should keephousing demand from falling sharply as income and wealth growthweaken.In the business sector, the slowing of output growth, depicted in themiddle left panel, will turn the accelerator effects on capital spendingnegative. But that should be partly offset by the favorable effect of acontinuing decline in the relative price of equipment--charted at the right.Inventory investment, the red line in the bottom left panel, is expectedto move pretty closely with final sales. Not much of a story there.And, finally, government purchases are projected to run a little strongeron balance over the next two years. In the state and local sector, surplusesare growing to the point where we would expect to see some greaterexpenditure on infrastructure. In the federal sector, real purchases areexpected to come closer to bottoming out, with some obvious upside risksin defense and other outlay categories. The pickup in governmentspending, however, is only a modest offset to the slackening in the growthof private demand that we foresee.Lew will now shift the focus from the domestic side to the externalsector.\n","1999-02-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).

Last summerwe were continuing to experience strong growth in economic activity and jobs. We tooksome easing actions because of the Asian crisis. We introduced additional stimulus intothis economy, which is playing out now. I think we could legitimately and forthrightlyexplain a tightening move as an unwinding of those earlier actions; that would make itmore acceptable. In the long term such an action would be healthy.Having said that, I would make the directive symmetric if the Committeeadopts a no-change policy, as it appears it might, because we probably will not act duringthe intermeeting period and I don’t think we should suggest otherwise. So my preferenceis to unwind. However, if we don’t, I would not have an asymmetric directive.\n","1999-03-30 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I don’t think it works for a major currency oreven a component of it in an NCB to have an aggressive reserve management program. For yourbenefit, we at the Federal Reserve--as I’m sure you pretty much take for granted--do not adjust thecurrency composition of our foreign currency reserves other than through official acts ofintervention. It’s routine for other central banks around the world to trade actively for profit in theexchange market and to hedge their reserve positions actively and dynamically. Malaysia comes tomind in its operations a number of years ago. When it’s a small country whose currency doesn’tplay a particularly dramatic role in the world economy, I think everyone knows how to deal withthat. When it’s a component of an institution that is one of the major central banks of the world, itreally is very different. The Bank of England, I want to be very clear, has a long tradition of beingan active foreign currency trader in the open markets. They’ve had some good and some badexperiences with that, and they’ve developed a century-long tradition that lends a note of distinction\f20to that kind of trading operation. I think that’s the exception that proves the rule rather than a goodpattern for others to follow.\n","2000-10-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.
