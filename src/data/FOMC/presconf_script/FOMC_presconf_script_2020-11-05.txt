CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committedto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment andprice stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to providerelief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lastingdamage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and Ireaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time.Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level. Thereopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rateof 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement hasmoderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and hasmoved above its pre-pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely dueto ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including traveland hospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes, in part, to federal stimuluspayments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to manyfamilies and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supportedin part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment has also picked up. Even so, overalleconomic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic, and the path ahead remainshighly uncertain.In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and Aprilhave been regained, as many people were able to return to work. As with overall economicactivity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated. The unemployment rateNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALAlthough we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans whoremain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and thoseleast able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level ofjoblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women,and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many livesand created great uncertainty about the future.The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines inthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goodsprices. However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remainparticularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-runobjective.As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy isextraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virusin check. The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, isparticularly concerning. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and towear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recoveryis unlikely until people are confident that it’s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promotemaximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilitiesto promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goalsand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusivegoal.” Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly onNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALhaving longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As we said in Septemberand again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieveinflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over timeand longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintainan accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes areachieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate tomaintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor marketconditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximumemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percentfor some time.In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasurysecurities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace. These assetpurchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodativefinancial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. At thismeeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing insupporting the recovery. At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantialrate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month ofagency MBS. We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preservefinancial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and areproviding substantial support to the economy. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitordevelopments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximumemployment and price-stability objectives as well as market functioning and financial stability.November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALThe Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directlysupport the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and forstate and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage tothe economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergencylending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only invery unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as abackstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lendersthrough normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Whenthe time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in thetoolbox.As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fedcannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities withbroad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans willbe repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. Butfor many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In thesecases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend andto make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. Thefiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is themost severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activityand employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued supportfrom both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALI’d like to mention a couple of changes that we plan on making to our Summary ofEconomic Projections beginning in December. First, we will release the entire package of SEPmaterials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out. Previously, some of thesematerials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes. This step will makemore information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributionsof forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections.Second, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments ofuncertainty and risks have evolved over time. These changes to the SEP will provide a timelyperspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections,thereby highlighting some of the risk-management considerations that are relevant for monetarypolicy.To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businessesacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed tousing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery fromthis difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. It’s Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.Thanks very much for taking my question. I’m wondering if you can speak specifically aboutwhat indicators you’re seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has moderated, including inthe labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases thatwe’ve seen going into flu season. Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, of course. Let’s start with February. In February, we hadan economy that was performing well. Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline inNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALactivity in March and April, and then we had a record bounceback in May and June. And so as Ithink would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and Junehas now moderated, so it’s not unexpected. And I think if you look at just about anything, youknow, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were justoutsized. And they’re certainly still very large, but they’ve—but the pace of improvement hasmoderated. That’s the case for, for all different measures in the labor force—in the labor market,rather. Another would be claims. Just about all the data were—showed a big bounceback. Butthen, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people—a lot of people go back to workat once, the pace will moderate. Same thing with economic activity. Most forecasts call for, youknow, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pacethat we had in the third quarter. So, in a sense, that would be—that would be as expected. Wehave been concerned that the downside risks, though, are, are prevalent now, which are—whichare really the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that, that households willrun through the savings they’ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that couldweigh on activity. But what we see up to the present, really, is, continued growth, continuedexpansion, but at, at a gradually moderating pace.

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be tothe economy if it does not get passed, say, before January?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So it is—obviously, it’s for Congress to decide the timing, size, andcomponents of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided bythe CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we’ve seen so far, whichNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALhas generally exceeded expectations. And I do think it’s likely that further support is likely to beneeded for monetary policy and fiscal policy. I just mentioned the two risks that I think we, weface, and those would be well addressed through more fiscal policy. One is the further spread ofthe virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people’sbalance sheets that will dwindle. But I, you know, I think it’s appropriate for us not to try toprescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what thesize of it should be and leave it at that.

NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. Tofollow on Marty’s question, you really have been saying since April that more is needed on thefiscal policy front, and yet we don’t seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring orthe summer to additional spending. Two questions: Would the lack of fiscal support compel theFed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocalabout the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth isdiminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates? Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So on your first question, you know, we’ll take into account allexternal factors and, and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursueour goals. That’s what we will do. And I’ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will gobetter and move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government.And we’ve said this in the very beginning: It’s really, first and foremost, health-care policy,getting the—getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics andvaccines and that kind of thing, getting—so that—those are absolutely critical to the economy.Now, those are important, as well as health policies. They’re, they’re going to be critical to theNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALeconomy. Fiscal policy can do what we can’t, which is to replace lost incomes for people whoare out of work through no fault of their own. And then we—what we can do is, we canobviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and we can supportdemand through, through interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing. So we’re,we’re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors.So I think all of us lived through the experience of the—of the years after the GlobalFinancial Crisis. And for a number of years there, in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policywas pretty tight. And. and I think I just would say that I think we’ll have a stronger recovery ifwe can just get at least some more fiscal support when it’s appropriate, you know, when it’sappropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate. I do think that that will likely—and,by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of theHill that suggests generally that there will be something.

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC.

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nickwas talking about, two questions about quantitative easing. The first is, if the market isfunctioning better, as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed forsmooth market functioning, why haven’t you reduced QE that you’re doing if the market isfunctioning better already? The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy,would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don’t seem tobe rising even above 1 percent? Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So, on the first—the first question, it’s—our asset purchases areserving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes: financial market function and support foreconomic activity. So—and that’s really been true—I think in the very beginning of the crisis,November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALthe main focus was, obviously, financial, financial market function, particularly in, in, you know,some of the major markets. But after that period, we’ve, we’ve understood all along that ourpurchases are also supporting economic activity, and that’s important. And that need hasn’tdwindled at all. So, so we haven’t looked at reducing purchases.So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have inplace are providing strong support to economic activity still. And, by the way, they’re sustainingthe gains we’ve made in financial stability. You know, we don’t—we don’t take anything forgranted. We, we don’t expect that things will deteriorate. But, nonetheless, we have a habit ofkeeping things in place for a while. So we’re not taking our gains in financial market functionfor granted, although, admittedly, they’ve been very large.So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policystance that we have. And, you know, as you know, these—we’re buying $120 billion a month.That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables. And it’s just providing a lot of support for,for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration riskfrom private hands as QE3 did. So this is a big program, and it’s doing a lot of good. And wealso, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease—notquantitative easing, the asset purchase program, and, you know, we understand the, the ways inwhich we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to beappropriate. Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about theright amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues.

CRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell. First, it’s great to see you’re okay. Chair Powell,what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment;November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALslower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I’m wondering, what’s stopping the FederalReserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscalsupport we might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zeroboundary or that the economy does when we exit this? Thanks.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So you did—you laid out nicely the, the risks of damageto the supply side of the economy, or “scarring,” as you put it. And we’ve been talking aboutthose since the very beginning of the pandemic. The risk is that, for example, people are out ofthe labor force for an extended period of time. They lose their attachment to the labor force, andit’s harder to get back. Your skills atrophy. It’s harder to get back in. And the record is, if youdon’t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in. And that holds down thewhole economy. And, by the way, it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who mayhave this happen to them at an important stage in their career. So it’s, it’s, it’s important.And, you know—so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and sourgent at the beginning and why we called this, this set of risks out. I don’t know how we couldbe much more vocal about it than we have been. Fortunately, for—you know, the economicrecovery has exceeded, certainly, the downside cases that we were very concerned about andeven, even exceeded—sort of exceeded the baseline expectations.Now, that’s so far. We are a long way from our goals. And, you know, we’re, we’re sortof halfway there on the labor market recovery at best. And, and there are parts of the economywhere it’s going to be hard until there’s a vaccine—you know, the parts of the economy. So, youknow, that’s the supply-side damage. That’s sort of the third thing that we talk about. The first,at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort. The second—then the second part was toNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALprovide support when—to the expansion when it came. And the third was to avoid longer-rundamage to the economy, and that’s, that’s all of these things.I think we have been vocal. You know, we’ll, we’ll try to continue to do that. And, andthose are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoidingunnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary longterm stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain theirfinancial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way. It’s, it’svery important that—you know, there is a real threat here of those things, and, and, you know,we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Yes, thanks. So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have,have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit,particularly acting as backstops to private markets. So, overall, we think that the, the programshave, have gone well. In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question.You know, we’ve had a lot of things to work our way through. Right now we’re just in theprocess of turning to that question and, of course, not made any decisions. And in terms of theprocess, this is a decision that, of course, we have to make and will make jointly with theTreasury Department.

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA. [Inaudible] IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote—Gita Gopinathwrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we’re in a global liquidity trap andNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALtalked about the limits of monetary policy right now. She said, “Fiscal policy will need to be themain game in town.” And it’s been a busy week. I don’t know if you were able to pick up thepink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have ratesbelow 1 percent. And I just wonder if you’d agree with her, in principle, that we are in a globalliquidity trap, and what the consequences of that would be. We’ve talked a lot about fiscalpolicy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to,to fiscal policy. My second question is, you talk about how you follow the epidemiology.You’re, you’re looking [inaudible].And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [inaudible] Christine Lagarde laying outwhat the ECB plans to do. As you lent an ear to what she had to say, the dire warnings that shewas making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe’s in, what can you and yourcolleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you’ve talked about and, andwe’ve all feared when it comes to a, a policy response?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Okay, thanks. So two questions. First, I, I take the sense of yourfirst question to be, is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo? And the answer to thatwould be “no,” I don’t think that. I think—I think that we are strongly committed to using thesepowerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long asneeded, and no one should have any doubt about that. And we do not doubt the power of thethings that we’ve already done or the things that we may, may do in the future. I do think there’smore that can be done. And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we’ve bought, ifyou look at the facilities and, and the way we’ve been able to keep accommodative financial—financial conditions accommodative, I think we’ve been able to do a lot of things that areNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALproviding very strong support for the economy. And we’re going to—we’re going to keepat that.I’ve said—we’ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular—that theparticular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on thepart of millions and tens of millions of people. It’s not so much a typical recession wheredemand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stimulate demand, and the economyrecovers. It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work. And the fiscalresponse was, was frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States. And it’scertainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it’s been so far. So I dothink fiscal policy is absolutely essential here. You know, stimulating aggregate demand is onething, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also needfiscal policy. And, of course, you need health-care policy too.I didn’t see Madame Lagarde’s comments this morning, but I, I took the sense of thatquestion to be the spread of the disease in Europe, and what do we think about that? Yes. So, asI mentioned in my—in my opening remarks, it’s a concern. We have a widespread spike incases across the country, more in some regions than others. And even if we don’t have—and Idon’t expect that we would—sort of government-imposed restrictions, it does seem likely,though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, stayingin a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars, and, and things like that, that they may pull back ina situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community.So I do think that that’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike.That, that could weigh on economic activity. One would expect that it would. We thought thesame thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West. And theNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALeconomy, you know, seemed to move right through that. This one seems to be larger and morewidespread. In any case, it’s a risk, is what I would characterize it—I would characterize it as arisk, as I did in my—in my comments.

[SECTION]

DAVID GURA. Can I ask a quick follow-up, just about the passions of the FedChairman? We’ve listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talkedabout what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it at first. You talked about the balancebetween monetary and fiscal policy. I think in your recent comments and in GovernorBrainard’s comments, certainly, there’s been more passion yet about the need for Congress to domore—I know that you’re limited in what you can say or the degree to which you’d want toadvise Congress, but a simple question: Do you feel that you’re being heard? As you look at theprospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those whoare crafting that policy, or could be, are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you’resaying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So let me—let me say, in the first instance, our, our main focus is ondoing our job, and that is really what we’re, we’re focused on is using the tools that Congress hasgiven us and the assignment they’ve given us. And I think we’re, we’re—that is the thing thatwe think about night and day. I just know from, from the experience of the last cycle, it helps tohave the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way. And I,I don’t—I think—you know, I, I don’t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not.But, sure, I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, onboth sides of the Hill, who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why thatmight be the case.

EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. So whatwould cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long-termsecurities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there also? And as a second pointonto that, you know, would—if there’s no fiscal stimulus package, would that then triggerbuying of more long-term assets or change the asset purchases?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So I don’t really have a specific hypothetical I would—I would putto you. I would just say that we, we understand that there are a number of parameters that wehave where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life, life cycle ofthe program. All of those things are, are available to us as ways to deliver addition—you know,more accommodation if we think that’s appropriate. Right now, we, we like the amount ofaccommodation the program is, is delivering. And it will just depend on the—on the facts andcircumstances. We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.Today’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzingthe various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those, thosevarious parameters, which I, I thought was quite a useful discussion.

VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to askabout climate change. FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators needto account for financial change—climate change, I’m sorry. What are you all thinking of doingon that front beyond what you’re already doing, and do you have any plans for joining thenetwork for greening the financial system?November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I, I do think that the public, public will expect and has everyright to expect that we—that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for allmaterial risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks. Climate change is,is one of those risks. It’s a relatively—the science and art of incorporating climate change intoour thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know. And we are, you know,very actively, in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bankcolleagues and other colleagues around the world to try to think about how this can be part of ourframework. And we’re watching what other—what other countries are doing.We’re active participants, as you know, in the CG—no, the greening the financial system.And, you know, we haven’t, we hadn’t actually formally joined, but we’re there. We’re in theworking groups, and we’re doing all of that. So we’re very much working with and monitoringthe things other central banks are doing. You hear—you know, there’s lots of research going onat the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this. These tend to belonger-term risks. But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time. And, you know, wetake it as our obligation to—you know, to understand these risks and incorporate them into our—into the way we supervise and, and think about the, the overall financial system and theeconomy.

CHAIR POWELL. So, on your first question, we, we really are just turning to this issuenow, and we have not made any decisions. We, we are just getting started on it, and, and it’s asay today. That’s all I have for you on that today.In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried abouthave, have subsided. And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes.And that—you know, that’s, that’s—what is to be expected of us is, is to think about how thingscan go wrong as well as the way things that can go right. But we, we have to—we do makepolicy from a risk-management standpoint. We don’t just look at the most likely case. We, weask, “How do you make policy in light of the risks?” and often it’s downside risks in a situationlike this. I would not say that anybody’s feeling comfortable about this, though. You know,we’ve gotten through the first five, six months of the—of the expansion better than expected, butwe do see in Europe—look what’s happening in Europe, look what’s happening here—anotherspike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more. So I think we have to behumble about where we are relative to this—to this disease. It hasn’t gone away. Clearly, youknow, therapeutics are advancing, research on vaccines are advancing, death rates are way down,hospitalization rates are, are lower now, but—so we’re learning. But, I mean, we, we are so—we’re very far from saying that we think we’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks. But I think,clearly, the tail risks have, have diminished since—at least our perception of them hasdiminished since earlier in the year.

SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Earlier this summer, I know that youformed a task force to look at the distribution of coins around the System. I wonder if you cangive us an update on how that’s going. I know there’s been some, some public relations effort. Ithink October was “Get the Coins Moving” month. Has that—has that problem subsided?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So let me say why it’s such an important—you know, in a worldwhere so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very importantfor the relatively low-income people. And so it’s a really incredibly important part of thepayment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it. And I actually just—I just caught up thismorning with the—with the person who heads that operation here who, who says that, yes, thingshave really gotten significantly better on the coin front. So we worked very hard to increase thesupply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the System and arehappy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself. So very pleased toreport that.

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi, FT.

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI. Thanks very much for the—for the question, Chair Powell. We’ve justhad a presidential election here in the United States. We still don’t know who the winner is. Areyou concerned that perhaps tensions or uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential electioncould pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil? And has the Fed had anydiscussions, either internally or with the Treasury Department, about responding to that, should ithappen?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So I’m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment onthe election directly, indirectly, at all, other than just to say that it’s a good time to take a stepback and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs. So, at the Fed here, we will, asNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALalways, continue to do our jobs. Every day we’ll continue to serve the American people usingour tools to support the economy during this difficult time. You know, the—you ask if we haddiscussions. I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is wetalk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world. We hear reports onhow households and businesses are doing. We talk about risks to the outlook. We talk aboutwhat the right policy response might be. And the election comes up in some—you know, itcomes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting. Not at all. So I, I’lljust leave it at that. Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that. Thanks.

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Anneken, CNN.

[SECTION]

ANNEKEN TAPPE. Thank you for taking my question. Chairman Powell, can you tellus a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility was reducedlast week and why that was done now rather than earlier, seeing that small businesses are still—clearly still—struggling to make the change necessary?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans.And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that’s the compensation that thebanks get. And there’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get—to get into the loanprogram and do—and to document the thing, the loans that they make because these are loansthat, you know, go on their balance sheet. They keep 5 percent, so they actually have tounderwrite the credit. And we’re relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that. And so wewere reluctant. We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go belowthat. But we heard, over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000.So—and, you know, we’ve been saying we’d have to redesign the program. And I, I gotthe question in a—in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that.November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALAnd I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay, so what would that look like if wewere to redesign the program in a way—what’s the least thing we could do to redesign theprogram so that we could move to a lower level? And it—basically, we concluded we could justchange the fee structure to create incentives for that, so we did that. We try to be responsive.We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow. And we’ll see how muchdemand will come.You know, with, with these programs, why did it—why didn’t we do it right away? Wetend to—it’s—there’s more work than one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one ofthese facilities. And you, you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to doeverything before you start it because you’ll never start it if you do that. Then you get it started,and you make changes. And we’ve been willing to make changes. That’s the most recent set ofones that we’ve done. And, again, we hope—we hope that it will help some companies, and Iguess we’ll find out.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Heather.

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT. Heather Scott this time, right? Thank you, Chair Powell, for takingthe question. You say that you’re—that you’re not out of ammo. So I’m wondering, then, whatis the next tool you expect to be able to roll out? Would you consider some sort of creditprogram for state and local businesses—state and local governments that are facing realbudgetary pressures?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So when I say we’re not out of ammo, I’m looking at, you know, acouple of our tools, mainly. As I mentioned, the asset purchase program—there’s a number ofdimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate. Right now, we like thejob it’s doing. We could, you know, if, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look atNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALnew facilities. If—you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you’d want toknows? But, certainly, the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful, Ithink, overall in accomplishing that job. So I do think there, there are things that we can do.But, remember, we’ve always said this will take a whole of government approach, includinghealth-care policy and fiscal policy too. So it really is, if you—if you want to get the economyback as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really it should be all ofgovernment working together.

[SECTION]

HEATHER SCOTT. If I could just follow up on that quickly. I mean, you spoke[inaudible] about the small business lending program. But that has only reached 400—there’sonly been 400 loans. When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there’s morethat can be done with another type of program or another redesign either for small businesses orfor assisting state and local governments?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Yes. There’s a bunch of programs. I would say that the, you know,the corporate—the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successfulwithout making a single loan—I think, unambiguously, has been a big success. I think thesuccess—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function sothat—whereas, you know, there were the, the sort of individual investors who wind up fundingloans in the muni market through. through mutual funds, they, they had withdrawn a lot ofmoney, and, and that—we’ve had many weeks of consecutive, I believe, of, of inflows there, andyou’re largely back to a normal functioning market. I think that’s also been a success. I thinkthe other—certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success.November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALThe—Main Street is just—is just a bigger challenge than all of them. Reaching out tosmall and medium-sized businesses through the banking system, which we had to do, is, is quitechallenging. I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP, were, were a great way to reachsmaller companies. You know, what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks, andthey’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now. Companies are not borrowing. And,and the reason is that, you know, activity’s at a relatively low level. They don’t want to run uptheir debt. You know, so I—we put, we put an awful lot into Main Street, and it is verychallenging to reach a lot of those companies. But I—you know, I think we, we are reachingmany of them now, and, and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg.

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, there’s a small but growing number of people,including some former Fed economists, who say you should find ways to go beyond yourmandate to provide additional support to the economy, which, in essence, would be fiscalsupport, since it hasn’t come from Congress. One of the suggestions is buying state andmunicipal securities directly. Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing assetpurchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury. Is there anycircumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified? How closelyare you willing to work with Treasury?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I’m going to take your question literally. And so if theidea is money-financed fiscal policy, that’s not something that we would consider. So that—what I mean by that is, is really, you know, the, the central bank is really funding fiscal activitiesof the government fairly directly. No, that’s not something we do. We have different jobs. ThatNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALknow, the job of taxation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and beenelected, and that’s the way it should be. There—they have to be responsible to the electorate.We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with a specific set of tools to supportmaximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervisebanks—all the things we’re assigned to do. But we, we, we’re not going to get into financing thegovernment and, and—by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don’t—it doesn’tactually, as you probably know, doesn’t change the amount of government debt outstanding. Weissue a reserve to, to purchase a Treasury security, and that’s just another form—on theconsolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that’s just another obligation. You changethe—you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debtthat the government has when you do these asset purchase programs. So I don’t know exactlywhat you’re referring to. But, you know, to—again, to take your question literally aboutfinancing fiscal activity, it’s really not something that we think the central bank should do and,and not something we’re looking at.

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up, there is a suggestion that you buy state andmunicipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage-backed securities,providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash-strapped at this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Well, we’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, sowe’re, we’re buying, you know, with, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that,that we’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury. We’re buying municipal securities of upto three years. So we’re doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3), youknow, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is allclearly laid out in the law. So we’re, we’re actually doing that now.November 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALBut I, I see—what that is, from our standpoint, is a rare thing that we do under section13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has brokendown. It’s no longer working. So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity. What turnsout to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working. So we only actuallyhave to do a backstop. The amount of financing that’s happened in the municipal markets thisyear is much higher than it was the prior year, and, and we didn’t do it. We did—we’ve done avery small number of, of loans. But just the fact that we’re there as a backstop seems to—seemsto get the private parties to get back together and, and get the market working again. So that’swhat 13(3) is for.We’re not—that shouldn’t be a permanent thing where we’re just another federalfinancing agency that’s available to direct credit to—you know, to very worthy borrowers. Thatwould be more along the lines of a GSE. That’s not what we do. We’re there to provideemergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when—you know, when—as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as wedid after the Global Financial Crisis and as we will here when the time comes.
