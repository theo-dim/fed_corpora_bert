CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committedto achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us—maximum employment andprice stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to providerelief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lastingdamage to the economy. Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strongforward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases.Together, these measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerfulsupport to the economy until the recovery is complete.Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level. Thesubstantial reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at anannual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace ofimprovement has moderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has beenstrong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remainslow, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel andhospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federal stimuluspayments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to manyfamilies and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supportedin part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment has also picked up. The recoveryhas progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants foreconomic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of EconomicProjections. Even so, overall economic activity remains well below its level before thepandemic, and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALIn the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March andactivity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated. Job growth slowed to245,000 in November, and while the unemployment rate has continued to decline, it remainselevated at 6.7 percent. Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemiclevels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, we will notlose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work. Looking ahead, FOMCparticipants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023. The economic downturnhas not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been thehardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wageworkers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economicdislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines inthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. Forthose sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularlysoft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective.The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023.As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy isextraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the course of the virus. Recent newson vaccines has been very positive. However, significant challenges and uncertainties remainwith regard to the timing, production, and distribution of vaccines as well as their efficacy acrossDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALdifferent groups. It remains difficult to assess the timing and scope of the economic implicationsof these developments. The ongoing surge in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the UnitedStates and abroad, is particularly concerning, and the next few months are likely to be verychallenging. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic. Followingthe advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masksin public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery is unlikelyuntil people are confident that it is safe to engage—reengage in a broad range of activities.As we previously announced, we are now releasing the entire package of our SEPmaterials at the same time as our FOMC statement. Included in these materials are two newexhibits that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks haveevolved over time. Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly all participants continue to judge thelevel of uncertainty about the economic outlook as elevated. In terms of risks to the outlook,fewer participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September.While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economicactivity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation.The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximumemployment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities topromote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goalsand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusivegoal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly onhaving longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As we reiterated in today’sstatement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflationmoderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time andDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALlonger-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain anaccommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes areachieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintainthe current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditionshave reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment andinflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase ourholdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backedsecurities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been madetoward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. We believe the increase in ourbalance sheet this year has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantialsupport to the economy.Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balancesheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative asthe recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome based and is tied to progress toward reachingour employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, theguidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lowerexpected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet. Overall,our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and willcontinue to do so.The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directlysupport the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and forstate and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage toDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALthe economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergencylending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only invery unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as abackstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lendersthrough normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.Although funds from the CARES Act will not be available to support new loans or newpurchases after—of assets after December 31, the Treasury could authorize support for emerginglending facilities, if needed, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund. When the time comes,after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the box.As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fedcannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities withbroad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans willbe repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. Butfor many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In thesecases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend andto make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. Thefiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is themost severe of our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activityand employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued supportfrom both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businessesacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed tousing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery fromthis difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

RICH MILLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Michelle. I wonderif I could start with the, the SEP. We have—unemployment now is at 6.7, the SEP median sees,sees it falling to 5. Headline inflation is one time 1.2, the SEP median sees it rising to 1.8. Andcore inflation is 1.4, and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise. Would that constitute “substantialfurther progress” toward the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Yes. Well, so we’re not—we’re not going to be identifyingspecific—associating that test with, with specific numbers at this point. So, really, the questionis, what do we mean by, by that language? And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is thatour guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policyaccommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved, andthat’s, that’s a powerful message. So “substantial further progress” means what it says. It meanswe’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum leveland inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start makingadjustments to our purchases.I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as addingpolicy accommodation. There will come a time when the economy does not require increasingamounts of policy accommodation. And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and,in any case, is, is some ways off. So I can’t give you an exact set of numbers. We will—ofDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALcourse, as we approach that point, we’ll be evaluating that. And when we see ourselves on apath to achieve that goal, then we will—we will say so undoubtedly well in advance of any timewhen we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases.

[SECTION]

RICH MILLER. Very quickly on, on that. You, you mentioned the next couple monthsare going to be very challenging. And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the durationof the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, again, I would start with what we actually did at themeeting, which, which was, we provided this, this guidance about the path of asset purchases.And I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward. And,you know, so I guess since September we’ve now adopted a flexible average inflation-targetingframework. We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed inthat new framework. And now we’ve done the same for, for asset purchases. So, you know,we’ve, we’ve been sort of—as, as the future has become clearer and as we’ve absorbed newdevelopments in medical—in the medical sphere and also in, in the economy, we have—began tobe able to see further. So we’ve, we’ve started to be able to provide further important guidance.And we think that the—that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important. We thinkthat the, the prior language of “in coming months” was obviously temporary. This links thatguidance, those purchases, to actual “substantial further progress” toward our, our mandatedgoals. We think that’s important. And we think that that is important to have done.I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance isappropriate. We think it’s providing a great deal of support for the economy. Financialconditions are highly accommodative. And, you know, we monitor a range of financialcondition indexes. There are many of them, and they’ll, they’ll all pretty much tell you that.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALYou can—you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy—for example,housing, durable sales, vehicle sales—those parts of the economy are, are performing very, verywell. The parts of the economy that are weak are the service-sector businesses that involve closecontact. Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of thevirus.And I’ll close by, by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide moreaccommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels. And werecognize that circumstances could shift in a way that warrants our, our doing that, including byadjusting purchases. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S.economy to achieve our goals. We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for aslong as it takes until the job is well and truly done. No one should doubt that.

NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, atwo-part question. What, if anything, would prompt the Fed to shift Treasury purchases towardthe longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs? And does your guidancetoday on asset purchases foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point, lengthenmaturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchase amounts?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Well, Nick, I—on, on the first part of the question, I, I don’t—Iwouldn’t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations. You know, we, we look at ouroverall stance of policy, we look at overall financial conditions, we look at what’s going on inthe economy—different parts of the economy, and we ask ourselves, should we change ourpolicy stance? We do that at every meeting. And we look at where financial conditions are now,December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALand, and we, we feel that they are appropriate for now. Anytime we feel like the economy could,could use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it. We—but right now,we’re providing a great deal, and we think—we happen to think it’s the right amount.And, you know, you, you mentioned—I think you’re referring to the idea of maintainingthe duration but, but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did. Andthat, that is something that we—you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and wasaddressed in the minutes. And I would say, the views on that were mixed: Some thought it wasan interesting idea, others not so much. I, I wouldn’t say that that’s something that’s, that’s highon our list of, of possibilities.

VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the13(3) facilities. Chair Powell, you’ve said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’sinterpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on, on what should happen with those programs.So, first of all, I’m curious whether under a new Treasury Secretary you will accept whateverlegal interpretation they put forward for those programs. And then, also, given that there isn’t astatutory requirement for you to have financial backing from Treasury for 13(3) facilities, do youhave any plans for any future facilities that don’t require Treasury backing?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So on your—on your first question, we really have not thought aboutthat. We’re, we’re very focused on—we have a lot to do now. We, we have not focused on, onthat question, and I, I really have nothing to add on that. Your second question is—sorry. Oh, ifthere were no—yes. No, we, we would have the ability—certainly, we would have the ability todo facilities under 13(3) in some cases with no backing. But we can’t do any 13(3) facilitiesDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALwithout the approval of the Treasury Secretary, right? But we did some facilities—I think one ofour facilities this time didn’t have any Treasury backing. And I think some in the—in the roundof—during the Global Financial Crisis also didn’t have any.

[SECTION]

VICTORIA GUIDA. So do you have any plans—like, would you consider doing morefacilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. I would say that we are—you know, we’re—we have the authoritieswe have. We will use them if, if they’re needed and if—and if the law permits us to do so. Wewould—we would always do that. We, we do not have any plans for, for the future about this.We—we’re very focused on, on getting through year-end. We’ve been very focused on, on theissues that are right in front of us. And, honestly, we’re not—we’re not planning on anything orhaving any discussions about what we might do down the road.

STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year. I know how muchyou enjoy talking about fiscal stimulus, so let me ask you directly about fiscal stimulus. There’stalk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress. Is, is that sufficient? Isthat what you’re looking for? Do you think that’ll be sufficient for helping the economy?Finally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is. I wonder if you can putsome detail on that. How much concern do you have in terms of, where could employment go?What could happen to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this surge? Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things.The case for fiscal policy right now is, is very, very strong. And I think that is widelyunderstood, I would say, now. The details of it are entirely up to Congress. But with theDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALexpiration of unemployment benefits—some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration ofeviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is, there’s a need for households andbusinesses to have, have fiscal support. And I do think that—again, I think that is widelyunderstood. So I think it would be—I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress isdoing right now. It’s not up to us to judge that work. It’s really, really theirs. And I, I don’thave a view for you on, on the size of it. It’s—you know, it’s obviously a substantial bill.On the surge, you know, so it’s a really interesting question. We have, and others too,have consistently expected there to be more economic—that, that cases would hold—growth incases would hold back the economy more than it actually has. So we’ve overestimated the, theeffects on the economy of, of these spikes we’ve been having.Now, this spike is so much larger that I think—and I think forecasters generally do thinkthat there—that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involvespeople getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that. Andyou’re starting to see that. In the—in the high-frequency data, you’re now beginning to see thatshow up. And I think if this is—the case numbers are so high and so widespread across thecountry that that, that seems like it must happen.Now, how big will it be? We don’t—we don’t really know. You know, there are—thereare a lot of estimates. The general expectation is, you’re seeing some slowing now. And you’llsee the first quarter could well be—what, what we said is that coming months are going to bechallenging. The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this.At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now. They’re getting vaccinated. Andby the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you’re going to be seeing significantnumbers of people vaccinated. And so then what will be—how will that play into economicDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALactivity? Again, we don’t have any experience with this. You have to think that sometime in themiddle of next year, you will—you will see people feeling comfortable going out and engagingin a broader range of activities. And some people will be probably quick to do that. Some aredoing it now without a vaccine—right?—in many parts of the country.So, nonetheless, my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that thesecond half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly. We should be—you know, we should be getting people back to work. Businesses should be reopening and thatkind of thing. The issue is more the next four or five months—getting through the next four,five, six months. That is key. And, and, you know, clearly there’s going to be need for helpthere. And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that.

JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I waswondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices. They were mentioned in the mostrecent minutes as, you know, potentially a valuation concern, especially as it related to yourmortgage-backed security purchases. And you mentioned earlier today that the housing marketlooks more or less fully healed. And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuationpressures there? And, if so, what can the Fed do to contain those?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in theeconomy, and housing prices are something that we’ve been monitoring. And you see themmoving up. You see very high demand. This, this is the housing market that people have beenexpecting since, you know, 2010. And, and then, you know, not many, when the—when thepandemic hit, thought, “Oh, this is what—this is what will produce that housing market,” butit has.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALNow, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not—are notof a level of concern right now. That’s just reflective of a lot of demand. And, you know,builders are going to bring forth supply. There’s also a sense that this—some of this may bepent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—oncethat demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable.So it’s a—it’s a healthy economy now. We, we met recently with a bunch ofhomebuilders, and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they’ve never seen the likes ofit. But, no, housing prices themselves are not—are not a financial stability concern at themoment. We will watch that carefully. But in the near term, I wouldn’t think that that’s an issuethat we’d be concerned about.

EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. So with theactions that you’ve currently taken, how do you—how do you further fight a slowdown thatyou’re seeing? We’ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month,the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down. Is there more the Fed can do to fight this?Or is it now squarely in the Congress’s realm?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. There is more that we can do, certainly. We can—we can expandour, our asset purchase programs. We can focus them more on the longer end. There are anumber of options we would have to provide more support to the economy.So I would—I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’tjust from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variablelags. It’s really support. As the—as—we’ve, we’ve talked about this as all of these governmentDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALpolicies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that wascreated by the pandemic. And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they’reacross it.But there’s a group for, for which they, they don’t have a bridge yet. And that’s whowe’re talking about here. It’s, it’s the 10 million people who lost their jobs. It’s people who maylose their homes. It’s—you know, you see the, the—many, many millions of Americans are, arewaiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country. So we know there’s need outthere. We know there are small businesses all over the country that, that have been basicallyunable to really function, and they’re just hanging on. So—and, and they’re, they’re so criticalto our economy. So—and, by the way, now that we can—we can kind of see the light at the endof the tunnel, it would be—it would be bad to see, you know, people losing their business, theirlife’s work in many cases, or even generations’ worth of work, because they couldn’t last anotherfew months, which is what it amounts to.So we have more we can do. And we’ll—I, I think more the issue is, we’re going to needto continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the, theeconomy will be growing in expectation. We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by thesecond half of next year. But it’s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of,of labor market—the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year andfor much of the last couple of years. So that’s how I think about it.

[SECTION]

HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for doing this. And thanks,Michelle. Two, two quick questions. One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed modeled,sort of a working estimate of when the U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity?And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on theare showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent. Some might argue that you needto do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say “We’re going to missour target for another three years” doesn’t show a very firm commitment to the new framework.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of the vaccine, yes, you know, we do estimates of, ofwhen the United States would reach herd immunity, and they’re, they’re going to be similar towhat other people think. You know, it depends on your assumptions, such as how many peoplewill actually take the vaccine and how fast will the rollout be. So it’s assumption based onassumption based on assumption. But, you know, sometime—it’s possible sometime in themiddle or second half of next year. I’m not going to try to be precise, because it’s just anotherestimate. You know, our people are very good, but they’re looking at, at the same data as otherpeople are. And so, you know, all the estimates are—it depends on what your assumptions are.But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as, as soon as the middle of next year.In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question. You know,we’re—I think you have to be honest with yourself about, about inflation these days. Thereare—there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there have been for awhile, and they persist today. It’s, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up. And it isn’tgoing to be just a question—it’s going to take some time. It took a long time to get inflationback to 2 percent in the last crisis.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALAnd, you know, we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that evenwith the very high level of accommodation that we’re providing both through low rates and veryhigh levels of asset purchases, it will take some time, because that’s what we believe theunderlying inflation dynamics are in our economy. And that’s sort of why we’re—one reasonwhy we’re concerned about inflation is that we see that. And, and that’s why we have adoptedthe flexible average inflation-targeting framework. That’s why we’re aiming for an overshoot.But we’re, we’re honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time toget there.In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to, to move assetpurchases, you know, I don’t think that would really be—I think it’s going to take a long timehowever you do it. And, you know, we’ve been having very long expansions since—in, in thelast several decades because inflation has not—really, the old model was, inflation would comealong and the Fed would tighten, and we’d have a recession.Now inflation has been low, and we haven’t had that dynamic. And the result has beenthree of the four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history. So, you know,we’re, we’re thinking that this could be another long expansion, and that we’ll keep our—whatwe’re saying is, we’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the expansion is welldown the tracks. And we’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actuallyreaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent. That’s a very strong commitment,and we think that’s the right place to be.

CHAIR POWELL. I’m just going to add, markets have actually found this fairlycredible. If you look at what—at inflation compensation and at the survey measures of, of whenthe Fed will lift off, everything has moved. There have been significant movements since weannounced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the—with the framework beingcredible to market participants. So I, I don’t think it’s something that—I, I mean, I’m actuallypleased by, by the reception it’s gotten in markets. And markets have moved in ways thatsuggest it is credible.

CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, thank you. Yesterday, I guess, the Fed said that it isjoining the international financial greening group. And I just wanted to see if you could expandon how the Fed is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed policy goingforward. Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climatechange when it comes to financial regulation. But how do you see that also potentially affectingmonetary policy? Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed for buying bonds of oil andgas companies. But leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there—is there any way thatclimate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So the—you’re, you’re talking about the—sorry, the Network [ofCentral Banks and Supervisors] for Greening the Financial System, which we joined this week.And I’ll just—I’ll just say a couple things about that. So, first, I’ll just start by saying that we’regoing to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate changeaffects our work, including the areas you mentioned. We’re going to do so with a great deal ofengagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their electedrepresentatives who are charged with our oversight. We’ll do it with great transparency.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALRemember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve thosegoals are set by Congress. We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we’ll usevigorously. We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out,debated, and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to ourstatutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities. And because we have a narrowremit, and because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence fromdirect political control. So society’s broad response to climate change is for others to decide—inparticular, elected leaders.But—so let me—let me get to your question. What does all that mean for an issue likeclimate change? And why did we join the NGFS? So Congress hasn’t explicitly assigned us orother financial regulators a role, and we’re not among the agencies who contribute to theNational Climate Assessment—Climate Assessment, for example. But climate change isnonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law. And let me tell you why.One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of thefinancial system. That’s a responsibility we share with other agencies. The public will expectthat we will—we will do that. So we’ll, we’ll expect that, that those important institutions willbe resilient against the many resists—risks that they fake—face: credit risk, market risk, cyberrisk. Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and theeconomy. And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what thatmeans, what needs to be done about it, and by whom. That’s why 83 central banks have joinedtogether to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area. We’vebeen attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the work. Wehad discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALI’ll just say that the financial system is really a global one. It’s important that we workand discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world, especially in a field where we’rejust beginning to develop our, our understanding.You asked about monetary policy. You know, I—I’ll say this. We, we have historicallyshied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation. In fact, our agreement with Treasuryduring the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’10 says that we will avoid credit allocation. It’ssomething we’ve carefully avoided. So I, I would be very reluctant to see us move in thatdirection, picking one area as creditworthy and another not.So you asked about monetary policy. You know, it’s, it’s—for now, I would say thereal—the real concern is—the real place to focus, for me, is supervision of financial institutionsand then financial stability concerns. You can see a connection there. Monetary policy,maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me. I can—I can, you know—I canmake the argument, but it’s less obvious to me that those should be first-order things that wewould look at in connection with climate change. But I think there’s—I think there’s work to bedone to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience offinancial markets and financial institutions. I think that work is in its early days. And, again,we’ll be careful. We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that.

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel.

[SECTION]

RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. Andthank you, Michelle. I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid. Just as one example,the governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to closethe budget deficit, and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that’s being debated this weekDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALseems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point. And I’m just curious if you can givesome detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid specifically to state andlocal governments will have on the recovery and, specifically, with the municipal lending facilityset to expire, what more the Fed might be able to do to fill that specific hole. Thanks very much.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So the state and local governments, they provide importantcritical services: safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that. They’re, they’re reallyinvolved in people’s lives, state and local governments are, to, to a large extent. The decisionwhether to, to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress. And, youknow, they’re in the middle of these discussions, and, and those, those are issues for them toI would say that the picture is mixed. What’s happened is, if you’re a state that has asignificant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground—oil from the ground, orgas—you are probably, at least in those industries, feeling a significant loss of revenue. Anumber of other states have been surprised on the upside, where—and that’s because goodssales, for example—property taxes are—don’t move much year to year. And, you know, thekind of sales taxes on goods—goods sales have been very high. Income has been more or lessreplaced by, by the CARES Act—fully replaced, more than, in many cases. So the concerns thatwe had at the very beginning of really serious, deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on thepart of state and local governments have not yet—have not yet occurred. What we’re seeing is,is that it’s different state to state. And some states are having significant difficulties, others notso much.The real concern, though, that still emerges is, state and local governments are very largeemployers, and—one of the largest. And so far, since the pandemic began, employment hasDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALdropped by 1.3 million in—of state and local government. So it’s, it’s a very large number ofpeople to be—to be out of work from just that one source. It’s actually significantly more thanlost their jobs during the Global Financial Crisis.So that is—that is a significant—a significant part of that group is, is in education. Sowhen the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work.Nonetheless, it’s a concern. We’re, we’re watching carefully to understand why that—why thatmany people have been let go and what are—really are the sources. So we’re monitoring itcarefully, and it’s a mixed picture. And I, I just have to leave the question of what to do withfiscal policy on this to Congress.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi.

[SECTION]

JAMES POLITI. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. You and the Fedhave consistently said that the Fed is ready to provide the economy with more monetary supportif needed and really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enoughoutweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there’s so much suffering in theeconomy. The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of time but isnot a big new easing step. Why was now, with the short-term outlook deteriorating due to thenew coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step? And is it because of themedium-term outlook improving? Or is it because the Fed just doesn’t have the capacity to sortof build that bridge over the next four to five months for the—for the people who are struggling?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Right. So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is,this is—this is a very, very large asset purchase program. It’s providing a tremendous amountof, of support for the economy. If you look at the interest-sensitive parts of the economy, they’reperforming very well. The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from highDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALinterest rates. They’re struggling from exposure to, to COVID, in a sense. These are—these arethe businesses that, that are really hit hard by people’s reluctance to gather closely.So, so we, we do have the ability to—you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer-termbonds. And, and we may—we may use it. I’m not saying we won’t—we won’t use that. It maywell come to, to using that. But also, I would remind—I would also note, though, monetarypolicy works with “long and variable lags,” is the famous statement. So we think that the bigeffects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future. So this lookslike a—you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy. And, andthat’s why it is, is a very positive thing that, that we’re getting that.So we, we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our assetpurchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buyinglonger maturities, because that had—that also increases accommodation by taking more durationrisk out of the market. But we think our current stance is appropriate. And we think that our—you know, that our, our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to theeconomy over time. Again, what we’ve—what we’ve done is, we’ve laid out a path wherebywe’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until—reallyuntil we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it’s been donein the past. So that’s, that’s providing significant support for the economy now.We don’t think the economy suffers from a lack of, of highly accommodative financialconditions. We think it’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage incertain kinds of economic activity. And we expect that, that with the virus, that that willimprove—that condition will improve. Nonetheless, again, we will—are prepared to use ourDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALtools, and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we—as we think would,would help.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Scott Horsley, NPR.

[SECTION]

SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Some forecasters have suggested thatthere is a lot of pent-up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like thatmight stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widelydistributed, and that the beaten-down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in,in a hurry. How might that affect inflation, in your mind? And would that be just a transientproblem or, or something that might warrant closer scrutiny?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the pricelevel. So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let’s say, you know, thatairfare, airfares—I’m just imagining this, right?—that they go up. But what inflation is, is aprocess whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year. And if—given the inflationdynamics that we’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-levelincrease has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases.And that, that was—the problem back in the 1970s was, it was the combination of twothings. One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up.But the second problem was that that—that that increase was persistent, there was a level ofpersistence. So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they’d go up 6 percent next year, becausepeople would internalize. I mean, really, really, that’s what happens is, people internalize thatthey can raise prices, and that it’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate. So that wasthe inflation—those are the inflation dynamics of that era.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALThose dynamics are not in place anymore. There—the connection between lowunemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was. It’s stillthere, but it’s a—it’s a faint heartbeat compared to what it was. And the persistence of inflation,if you—if you get a—for example, oil prices go up, and that’ll send a temporary shock throughthe economy. The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there. So they—what you describe may happen, and, of course, we would watch it very carefully. We, weunderstand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it willbehave in certain cases. But I would—I would expect, though, going in that that would be aone-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby.

[SECTION]

MICHAEL DERBY. [Inaudible]—question. But what I wanted to ask was, you know,given the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes inthe financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market, long run, can operate smoothlywithout some sort of active Fed presence—you know, buying Treasury debt? You know, I’mreferring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles. He had some questions about it. So I wanted toknow where you stood on that issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Right. So—you were breaking up a little. I think—I think I got thesense of it, though. Yes, I, I don’t think it’s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be aDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALpermanent Fed presence. And we certainly don’t—you know, that’s not something we’replanning on or intending. Right now we’re buying assets because it’s a—you know, it’s a—it’s atime when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our assetpurchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balancesheet.You know, there’s lots of demand for, for U.S. Treasury paper all—from all over theworld. And I, I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market andlook at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector.And there’s, there’s quite a lot of work going on on that front. But I, I don’t presume at all that,that this is something that needs to be—where the Fed needs to be in there at all. I, I would thinkthat this should be handled by the private sector and can be. Institutions need to be able to holdthis paper. And there may be—there may be a central clearing angle that would, you know, net alot of risk. That’s, that’s yet to be proven. There are a lot of things that are being looked atright now.

[SECTION]

HANNAH LANG. Hi, hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. So, you know, asyou know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium-sizedbusinesses. And the Fed launched a few efforts this year to—through its 13(3) programs to reachout to those companies. But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, isthere anything else that the Fed’s actions can do to provide support to those companies? Or isthat solely Congress’s domain?December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. I think the main thing that those companies need is a—is a robustrecovery—a strong, robust recovery. And so we, we contribute to that through highlyaccommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that aresupporting economic activity. Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, youknow, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of thosevaccines. And Congress contributes, contributes to that by helping them make it through thisvery difficult time. And, and I think my understanding is that there’s support for smallbusinesses in, in what’s being discussed on Capitol Hill. I would certainly think that would besomething well worth looking at.

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we’ve had a—and I’ve had sort of the typicalmeetings with the transition team for Treasury. They’ve met with quite a lot of people in ouragency and other agencies. And, really, it’s about learning what we do. And I, I really have onlyspoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated and just to say that I lookforward to working with her. You know, I did work very closely with her for five years beforeshe left and have stayed in touch, you know. So I did that. But I have not discussed, you know,policy with her. And I, I’m not going to do that until she’s confirmed.

MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Jeff Cox.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

JEFF COX. Yes. Chair, thank you for taking the question. You’ve been asked thisquestion before in various forms. I’m going to try it a little bit differently now. The equityare heading. We [inaudible] on the stock market, bond yields remain very low. Does thatconcern you at all? Are, are you getting any more concerned about asset valuations in, in light ofthe highly accommodative Fed policies?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. You, you were breaking up, but I, I think I got that. I think I got it.So, you know, financial stability—we, we look at a broad range of things. We actually have aframework so that we can, you know, be—evaluate changes in financial stability over time, andso that the public can evaluate whether we’re doing a job—a good job at it. We—so what do welook at? Asset prices is one thing that we look at. And, you know, we published a report a fewweeks ago on that—maybe it was month or so ago. Anyway. And I think you’ll find a mixedbag there. It depends—with equities, it depends on whether you’re looking at P/Es or whetheryou’re looking at the premium over risk-free—over the risk-free return.If you look at P/Es, they’re historically high, but, you know, in a world where the—where the risk-free rate is sustain—is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium,which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you’d look at. Andthat’s not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they’re not overpriced in thatsense. Admittedly, P/Es are high, but that’s—you know, that’s, that’s maybe not as relevant in aworld where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it’s been historically, froma—from a return perspective.You know, we look at—we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions.We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years building up their capital. So far, they’ve been aDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALsource of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well. We look at leverage inthe nonfinancial sector—that’s households and nonfinancial corporates. Nonfinancial corporateleverage is high. We’ve been watching that. But, you know, rates are really low. So—and socompanies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are—rates are quite low. Your interest payments are low. Defaults and downgrades have, havebeen a hit there for people who are unemployed. But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congressreplaced a lot of lost income. You know, it’s very important that, that the economy gets strongagain. I mean, the, the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy.The last thing is, is really funding markets. We found that there was a lot of unstablefunding for companies, particularly financial companies. And that’s, that’s down to a—to a verylow level these days. So the broad financial stability picture is, is kind of mixed, I would say. Iwould say, you know, asset prices are, are a little high in that metric and in my view. But,overall, you have a mixed picture. You, you don’t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that.So—and it’s—again, it’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily. Youknow, we’re, we’re monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework,and, you know, we’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed. So we workvery hard at it.

[SECTION]

MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. And for the last question we’ll go to Michael McKee.

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscalsupport for the economy. This year’s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion. And Republicans haveargued they don’t want to spend more, because we can’t afford it. So I’m wondering if you canDecember 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINALmake the case for how much we can afford. At what point do deficits and the debt start to havean impact on the economy or on interest rates? And how would we know when we get there?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. So people who—people who run for elected office and win, they’rethe ones—their reward is they get to make those very difficult decisions. And—you know, sowe’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress. But I, I would just say, as ageneral—as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path. For my way ofthinking and many others’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and whenunemployment is low and taxes are—you know, are, are pouring in, and there’s, there’s room toget on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy’s really doing well. You’re still now inthe—in the, you know, some part of, of an economic crisis. And the fact that Congress isdebating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that—you know, suggests that something fairlysubstantial is going to get done, we hope—that what’s being discussed is, you know, is, is ofsome size.In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it’s—the question is—we’vealways looked at debt to GDP, and we’re very high by that measure. By some other measures,we’re actually not that high. In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, theamount of, what does it cost? And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interestcosts of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we’re actually—you know, we’re actually ona more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes. Again, these are—these areissues for Congress. But, you know, I’ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal—the case for, forfiscal is, is strong. And I’m certainly hoping—I think it will be very good for the economy if, ifwe did get something soon.December 16, 2020Chair Powell’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, the argument for continuing to spend is that low interestrates make it affordable. Do you worry you get in a situation where you would havecongressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressureto keep rates low because the country can’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?

[SECTION]

CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean, that’s—I think we’re a very, very long way from that.You know, the, the Congress has given the Fed independence on the condition that we stick toour knitting. We try very hard to do that. And I, I think that’s, that’s what people call fiscaldominance. And I, I think we’re just a very, very long way from that. I think, you know, ifwe—if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment andstable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don’t think that that is something that will—thatI would worry about, certainly not in the near term.
