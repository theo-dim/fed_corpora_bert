CHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decidedto raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ¾ to1 percent. Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policyaccommodation reflects the economy’s continued progress toward the employment and pricestability objectives assigned to us by law. For some time the Committee has judged that, ifeconomic conditions evolved as anticipated, gradual increases in the federal funds rate wouldlikely be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives. Today’s decision is in line withthat view and does not represent a reassessment of the economic outlook or of the appropriatecourse for monetary policy. I’ll have more to say about monetary policy shortly, but first I’llreview recent economic developments and the outlook.The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Solid income gains and relativelyhigh levels of consumer sentiment and wealth have supported household spending growth.Business investment, which was soft for much of last year, has firmed somewhat, and businesssentiment is at favorable levels. Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand ata moderate pace over the next few years.Job gains averaged about 200,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining thesolid pace we have seen over the past year. The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February,near its recent low. Broader measures of labor market underutilization also remain low.Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years. Given theunderlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S.population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in thelabor market. Looking ahead, we expect that job conditions will strengthen somewhat further.March 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALTurning to inflation, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumptionexpenditures rose to nearly 2 percent in January, up from less than 1 percent last summer. Thatrise was largely driven by energy prices, which have been increasing recently after earlierindicator of future inflation—has been little changed in recent months at about 1¾ percent. Weexpect core inflation to move up and overall inflation to stabilize around 2 percent over the nextcouple of years, in line with our longer-run objective.Let me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting byCommittee participants. As always, participants conditioned their projections on their ownindividual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’sassessment of the many factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for growth ofinflation-adjusted gross domestic product is 2.1 percent this year and next, and edges down to1.9 percent in 2019, slightly above its estimated longer-run rate. The median projection for theunemployment rate stands at 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and remains at thatlevel over the next two years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate.Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.9 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and2019. These economic projections are very little changed from those made in December.Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federalfunds rate is appropriate in light of the economy’s solid progress toward our goals of maximumemployment and price stability. Even after this increase, monetary policy remainsaccommodative, thus supporting some further strengthening in the job market and a sustainedreturn to 2 percent inflation. Today’s decision also reflects our view that waiting too long toscale back some accommodation could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometimeMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALdown the road, which, in turn, could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economyinto recession.We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradualincreases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain our objectives. That’s based on ourview that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neitherexpansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel—is currentlyquite low by historical standards. That means that the federal funds rate does not have to rise byall that much to get to a neutral policy stance. We also expect the neutral level of the federalfunds rate to rise somewhat over time, meaning that additional gradual rate hikes are likely to beappropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion. Even so, the Committeecontinues to anticipate that the longer-run neutral level of the federal funds rate is still likely toremain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percentat the end of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, in line with its estimated longer-runvalue. Compared with the projections made in December, the median path for the federal fundsrate is essentially unchanged.As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust theirassessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to theireconomic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks. Changes in economic policies,including fiscal and other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it isstill too early to know how these policies will unfold. Moreover, fiscal policy is only one ofmany factors that can influence the outlook. In making our decisions, we will continue—asMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALalways—to assess economic conditions relative to our dual mandate. As I’ve noted previously,policy is not on a preset course.Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities andprincipal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. This policy, by keepingthe Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintainaccommodative financial conditions. As a matter of prudent planning, we discussed at thismeeting a number of issues related to an eventual change to our reinvestment policy. We madeno decisions, and we will continue our discussion at subsequent meetings. In keeping with theprinciple that the process of normalizing our balance sheet will be gradual and predictable, wewill provide more information about our plans as it becomes available.Thank you. I’d be happy to take your questions.

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Could Itake you up on the last topic, which is the balance sheet normalization? Clearly you said youdon’t want to start pulling in the size of the balance sheet until normalization “is well underway.” Could you give us some sort of sense about what “well under way” means, at least in yourmind? What kind of hurdles are you setting? What kind of economic conditions would you liketo see? Is it just a matter of the level of the short-term federal funds rate as being the main issue?And what kind of role do you see the role of the balance sheet playing in the normalizationprocess over the longer term? Is it an active tool, or is it a passive tool? Thanks.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So let me start with the second question first. We’ve emphasized forquite some time that the Committee wishes to use variations in the fed funds rate target—ourshort-term interest rate target—as our key active tool of policy. We think it’s much easier inusing that tool to communicate the stance of policy. We have much more experience with it andMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALhave a better idea of its impact on the economy. So while the balance sheet, asset purchases area tool that we could conceivably resort to if we found ourselves in a serious downturn where wewere, again, up against the zero bound and faced with substantial weakness in the economy, it’snot a tool that we would want to use as a routine tool of policy.You asked what “well under way” means. I can’t give you a specific answer to that. AndI think the right—the right way to look at it is in qualitative and not quantitative terms. It doesn’tmean some particular cutoff level for the federal funds rate that, when we’ve reached that level,we would consider ourselves well under way. I think what we want to have is confidence in theeconomy’s trajectory, a sense that the economy will make progress, that we’re not overlyworried about downside risks and adverse shocks that could hit the economy that couldquickly—after setting it off on the path to shrinking the balance sheet gradually over time—cause us to want to begin to add monetary policy accommodation. So I think it has to do withthe balance of risks and confidence in the economic outlook and not simply the level of thefederal funds rate.

[SECTION]

JASON LANGE. Hi, thank you. Jason Lange with Reuters. You mentioned that youdon’t—that you don’t—you want to not have to raise rates rapidly if you were to fall behind thecurve. In the current context, “gradual” has been very, very gradual. Could you describe what arapid rate of increases should be—how that should be understood?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I’m not sure that I can tell you what “a rapid rate of increases” is.I think the trajectory that you see is the median in our projections, which, this year, looks to atotal of three increases. That certainly qualifies as gradual. My comfort in using the term“gradual” comes back, in part, to my judgment that the neutral level of the federal funds rate—namely, the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy operating on an evenMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALkeel, that it’s a rate where we neither are pressing on the brake nor pushing down on theaccelerator—that level of interest rates is quite low. So, at present, I see monetary policy asaccommodative—namely, the current level of the federal funds rate is below that neutral rate, butnot very far below the neutral rate.We’re closing in, I think, on our employment objective. We’re coming closer on ourinflation objective. As we reach those objectives, and particularly in light of the fact that we seethe risks to the outlook as roughly balanced at this point—and that’s been our assessment for thelast several meetings—it looks to us to be appropriate to gradually raise the federal funds rateback in the direction of neutral. And exactly how many increases is that? You know, the SEPgives you a sense of what Committee participants envision in a concrete sense. But, you know,if it’s one more or one less, I think that still—that still qualifies to my mind as gradual, I think, ifyou compare it with any previous tightening cycle. I remember when rates were raised at everymeeting starting in mid-2004. And I think people thought that was a gradual pace, a measuredpace. And we’re certainly not envisioning something like that.

STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Both the OECD and the IMF have raisedtheir forecasts, in part because of—for the U.S. growth—in part because of the policies expectedfrom the new Administration, yet the Fed has not. And I take it from your comment at the verybeginning that this—these forecasts today represent no reassessment. Has the Committeediscussed what policy might look like in the event that there are large tax cuts passed orinfrastructure spending passed? And what might policy look like if those policies become law?Finally, why did you remove the word “only” before the word “gradual” when you talked aboutfuture rate increases?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So we have not discussed in detail potential policy changes that couldMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALbe put into place, and we have not tried to map out what our response would be to particularpolicy measures. We recognize that there is great uncertainty about the timing, the size, thecharacter of policy changes that may be put in place and don’t think that that’s a decision, or aset of decisions, that we need to make until we know more about what policy changes will gointo effect. So I do want to emphasize that, while some participants have penciled in some fiscalpolicy changes into their projections, that the basis for today’s decision is simply our assessmentof the progress of the economy against our long-established goals of maximum employment andprice stability. There’s nothing that we have done or anticipate that is a speculation. I think it’sfair to say, there’s nothing that’s a speculation about preemptive responses to future policymoves. We have plenty of time to see what happens.We did remove the word “only” in the statement today from “gradual.” I think this issomething that shouldn’t be overinterpreted. I regard it as a relatively small change and thinkit’s appropriate for you to consider it in the context, for example, of the fact that our economicprojections are virtually identical to those that we issued in December. They’re essentiallyunchanged both in terms of the path of the economy and the path of the federal funds rate. Sowe have carried out a modest adjustment of the federal funds rate because we’ve seen theeconomy progressing over the last several months in exactly the way that we anticipated. Wehaven’t in any way changed our view about where the economy is heading or the risks. We hadlong said that if the economy progressed, and—it’s, you know, it’s been doing nicely, I think, inmaking progress, in showing resilience, and we have, you know, have some confidence in thepath the economy is on. And if we continue to feel that, we will likely regard it as appropriate tomake some further moves to scale back accommodation to move toward neutral, along the linesin the SEP.March 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALNow, obviously, there are surprises. Our economic forecasts can change. But the word“gradual,” I think, emphasizes that if things continue in the manner that we’ve been going, as wehave said now for quite some time, we think that gradual—some gradual increases in the federalfunds rate—will be appropriate. And this is not a, you know, this is not a significant—this is nota significant change.

PETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business, ma’am. Speaking of fiscal policy, haveyou had a chance to meet with the new Treasury Secretary yet, Mr. Mnuchin? If not, when willyou meet with him? What do you want to talk to him about? And, separately, have you had achance to talk to President Trump yet or meet with him? And, if not, would you like to, andwould you, and what would you talk about? Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. I’ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I’mgetting to know him. And I think, you know, it’s traditional for Fed Chairs and TreasurySecretaries to meet on a regular basis, and I fully expect to have a strong relationship withSecretary Mnuchin. We have had very good discussions about the economy, about regulatoryobjectives, the work of the FSOC, global economic developments, and I look forward tocontinuing to work with him. I was introduced to the President. I had a very brief meeting andappreciated that as well.

[SECTION]

ANA SWANSON. Ana Swanson, the Washington Post. You said that the neutral levelof the federal funds rate is quite low. How close do you judge it to be to the inflation rate? Andwhat do you anticipate will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next fewyears? Could fiscal policy be among those?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I’ve given a number of recent speeches on this topic where I’vedeveloped my views more fully. I would say, over the longer run—that means going severalMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALyears out—I think the evidence suggests that the neutral rate may be something, in real terms,that might be close to 1 percent or a little bit under that. That would be consistent with themedian longer-run value of the federal funds rate in our economic projections for the last severalmeetings. Three percent is the longer-run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate. Inreal terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms. And I’veindicated—why is it so low? Well, I think there’s very strong evidence that’s accumulated thatthis rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations, and thegrowth and also slow productivity growth here and in many other advanced nations. But somerecent work suggests that, at the present time, the neutral real rate is yet lower than that, andsome estimates place it around zero in real terms. So I think the lower current rate arguablyreflects headwinds that are left over from the financial crisis. One form of headwind, I think, hasbeen caution and restraint and risk aversion on the part of households and businesses that’s heldback spending decisions. And, I suppose, my judgment that it’ll move up over time reflects anotion that part of that will gradually dissipate over the years.So that’s a sense of where I think—now, there is uncertainty about the neutral rate. And,as you mentioned, it is—it can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy. How the neutral rate isaffected by fiscal policy—that really depends importantly on the nature, the size of the fiscalshift and the effect it has both on demand and supply in the economy.

NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Yellen,between the release of the minutes of the previous meeting late last month and your speech inChicago earlier this month, market expectations about an increase in rates today changed quitedramatically. What happened over the course of those two weeks to make officials far moreMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALinterested in signaling the idea of raising rates at today’s meeting? And why do you think the

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, when I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to meto have been reasonably consistent over this entire period. We had indicated in December thatwe expect—we saw the risks as balanced, and if the economy continued to progress along thelines we expected, that several rate increases would likely be appropriate. The minutes of ourbe appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those lines. I indicated in my congressionaltestimony that I thought that, indeed, the economy was progressing in line with our expectations.And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progressalong the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it asappropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rateincreases this year. As we saw the data continue to come in in line with our expectations, mycolleagues and I spoke out and indicated that, indeed, that had been and continued to be ourexpectations.Now, you know, when you ask me, how did we get out of sync with the market, this issomething I tried to reflect on a bit in the remarks I made in Chicago. And, of course, it is truethat in 2015 and in 2016 each, we raised the federal funds rate only once, and perhaps marketparticipants have been influenced by that pattern. I did try to explain the reasons why we hadmoved so slowly during those two years. And it reflects, I think, a set of shocks partlyemanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as morefundamental assessments—reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rateand the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate. So I think there are reasons, but it isMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALimportant for the public to understand that we’re getting closer to reaching our objectives; thatpolicy is accommodative; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probablyquite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy; and it will be appropriate togradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we’re on.

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. The Bank forInternational Settlements has raised concerns that central banks are being insufficiently attentiveto asset price—excuse me, asset price inflation. And stock market investors in the United Statescertainly don’t seem to be waiting for the Trump Administration to actually implement its fiscalpolicies. And I guess I’m just curious to know how much of a concern that is for you. And, ifnot, why not, given the remarkably elevated level of stock price evaluations?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, we do look at financial conditions in formulating our view ofthe outlook, and stock prices do figure into financial conditions. So I think the higher level ofstock prices is one factor that looks like it’s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.We also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads, particularly for lower-gradecorporate issuers, have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have becomesomewhat easier. Now, on the other side, longer-term interest rates are up some in recentmonths, and the dollar is a little stronger. How does that net out? There are private-sectoranalysts that produce financial conditions indices that attempt to aggregate all these differentfactors affecting financial conditions. And for some of the more prominent analysts and indices,I think the conclusion they have reached is that financial conditions, on balance, have eased, andthat’s partly driven by the stock market. So that is a factor that affects the outlook.Mnuchin will be meeting with your G-20 colleagues in Germany this weekend. What do youMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALexpect to find there? Do you think the group assessment is going to be that the world economyis finally out of the woods, doing better? Or do you think that there’s still going to be worriesabout risk? And would one of those risk worries be that the Fed might raise rates too quickly?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, we always exchange views on the economic outlook anddevelopments in our country, and it will be my objective to explain—explain U.S. monetarypolicy and to try to make the same points to them that I’ve made here already today about whatthe outlook is for monetary policy in the United States. I think it’s fair to say that the globaleconomy is doing better. It’s growing a bit more strongly than it was, perhaps, the last time I gottogether that the—with my counterparts in the G-20—that the risks do look somewhat morebalanced. But there remain a set of very significant risks, medium term, facing the globaleconomy, and I’m sure that those will be discussed as well.

JIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times. You said youand your colleagues aren’t making assumptions about stimulative fiscal policies, but many otherpeople are. Business and consumer confidence has jumped since the election. Homebuildersentiment today was at its highest level since 2005. Are you concerned about the effects on theeconomy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending, don’t get enactedor are delayed?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So we recognize—our statement actually last time noted that therehad been an improvement, a marked improvement in business and household sentiment. It’suncertain just how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions. And I wouldn’t say atthis point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based onexpectations about the future. We exchange around the table what we learn from our manybusiness contacts, and I think it’s fair to say that many of my colleagues and I note a much moreMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALoptimistic frame of mind among many—many businesses in recent months. But, I’d say, most ofthe business people that we’ve talked to also have a wait-and-see attitude and are very hopefulthat they will be able to expand investment and are looking forward to doing that but are waitingto see what will happen. So we will watch that. And, of course, if we were to see a major shiftin spending reflecting those expectations, that could very well affect the outlook. I’m not seeingit—I’m not seeing that at this point, but the shift in sentiment is obvious and notable.

KATE DAVIDSON. Thank you, Madam Chair. Kate Davidson from Dow Jones.There’s a perception out there that the Fed could somehow stand in the way of some of theeconomic growth policies that the new Administration is pursuing. Given that the Fed isprojecting 1.8 percent growth in the long run, is this a potential point of conflict for the Fed andthe new Administration?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I don’t believe it is a point of conflict. We would certainlywelcome stronger economic growth in a context of price stability. And if policies were put inplace to speed growth that I’ve certainly urged Congress and the Administration to consider—policies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy’s so-called speed limit orpotential to grow—I think that those would be—those would be very welcome changes that wewould like to see.

KATHLEEN HAYS. Chair Yellen, Kathleen Hays. Oh, excuse me, Kathleen Hays fromBloomberg. I’m going to try to take the opposite side of this because—on this question aboutsuddenly clarified what it already said. But, for example, if the—if you look at the Atlanta Fed’slatest GDP tracker for the first quarter, it’s down to 0.9 percent. We had a retail sales report thatwas mixed. Granted the, you know, upward revisions of previous months make it look better,March 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALbut the consumer does not appear to be roaring in the first quarter, kind of underscoring the waitand-see attitude you just mentioned.If you look at measures of labor compensation, you note in the statement that they’re notmoving up, and, in fact, they are. And if you look at average—there are so many things you canlook at. And you yourself have said in the past that the fact that that is happening is perhaps anindication there’s still slack in the labor market.I guess my question is this: In another sense, what happened between December andinflation any time fast. The consumer is not picking up very much. Fiscal policy—we don’tknow what’s going to happen with Donald Trump. And yet you have to raise rates now. Sowhat is the—what is the motivation here? The economy is so far from your forecast in terms ofGDP, why does the Fed have to move now? What does this signal, then, about the rest of theyear?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So GDP is a pretty noisy indicator. If one averages through severalquarters, I would describe our economy as one that has been growing around 2 percent per year.And as you can see from our projections, we—that’s something we expect to continue over thenext couple of years. Now, that pace of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creationthat is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down inline with what we see as its longer-run trend with an aging population.Now, unemployment hasn’t moved that much, in part because people have been drawninto the labor force. Labor force participation, as I mentioned in my remarks, has been about flatover the last three years. So, in that sense, the economy has shown over the last several yearsthat it may have had more room to run than some people might have estimated, and that’s beenMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALgood. It’s meant we’ve had a great deal of job creation over these years. And there could be—there could be room left for that to play out further. In fact, look, policy remainsaccommodative. We expect further improvement in the labor market. We expect theunemployment rate to move down further and to stay down for the next several years. So we doexpect that the path of policy we think is appropriate is one that is going to lead to some furtherstrengthening in the labor market.

[SECTION]

KATHLEEN HAYS. [Inaudible] Just quickly, then, I just want to underscore—I want toask you, so following on that, you expect it to move. But what if it doesn’t? What if GDPdoesn’t pick up? What if you don’t see wage measures rising? What if you don’t—what if thecore PCE gets stuck at 1.7 percent? Would you—is it your view, perhaps, that if there’s a riskright now in the median forecast for dots, that it’s fewer hikes this year, rather than theconsensus, or more?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, look, our policy is not set in stone. It is data dependent, andwe’re—we’re not locked into any particular policy path. Our—you know, as you said, the datahave not notably strengthened. I—there is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter, butwe haven’t changed our view of the outlook. We think we’re on the same path, not—we haven’tboosted the outlook, projected faster growth. We think we’re moving along the same coursewe’ve been on, but it is one that involves gradual tightening in the labor market. I woulddescribe some measures of wage growth as having moved up some. Some measures haven’tmoved up, but there’s some evidence that wage growth is gradually moving up, which is alsosuggestive of a strengthening labor market.And we expect policy to remain accommodative now for some time. So we’re—we’retalking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progressMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALmoving toward neutral. But we’re continuing to provide accommodation to the economy that’sallowing it to grow at an above-trend pace that’s consistent with further improvement in thelabor market.

JOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with the American Banker. A regulatoryquestion, if I may. The Administration has recently reiterated its support for a reinstatement ofGlass-Steagall. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has called for a “21st century Glass-Steagall.”Keeping in mind that there are no specifics on this proposal, is the fundamental idea ofright path to be pursuing?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I’ve not seen any concrete proposals along this line. I don’treally know what a “21st century Glass-Steagall” would look like. I think my reading on thefinancial crisis is that that wasn’t the major source of the financial crisis. In fact, many of theproblems emanated from firms that were investment banking units. To me, an important reformin the aftermath of the crisis was to make sure that investment banking activities where—thatwere a core part of the shadow banking system where leverage had built—that those wereappropriately capitalized, had appropriate liquidity, and their management was strengthened, andthat’s what we have tried to do. But, obviously, we would look at any proposals that are putforward. I’m not aware of anything concrete to react to.

JOHN HELTMAN. So—so you don’t think it’s necessarily [inaudible] a really goodidea?

JO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Yellen. I’m Jo Ling Kent with NBC News. I just want toknow, what message are you trying to send consumers with this particular rate hike?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. I think that’s a great question. I appreciate your asking it. And thesimple message is, the economy is doing well. We have confidence in the robustness of theeconomy and its resilience to shocks. It’s performed well over the last several years. We havecreated, since the trough in employment after the financial crisis, around 16 million jobs. Theunemployment rate has moved way down, and many more people feel optimistic about theirprospects in the labor market. There is job security. We’re seeing more people who are feelingfree to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities. So I think the jobThat’s not to say that it’s a—good labor market conditions for every individual in theUnited States. We know there are problems that face, particularly, people with less skill andeducation and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a strongerlabor market and feel better—feel very much better about that. And inflation is moving—moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective. And we’re operating in an environmentwhere the U.S. economy is performing well and risks seem pretty balanced. So I think peoplecan feel good about the economic outlook.

JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News. You emphasized in thestatement that the Fed’s inflation target is “symmetric.” Would you be able to expand a little biton why you did that, why it was included, how much of an overshoot would the Fed be willing totolerate, and for how long?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, a couple of years ago, we included the word “symmetric” inour statement of longer-run goals, and this seemed like an appropriate time to introduce thatMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALword into the statement because we had previously indicated that there was a shortfall ofinflation from our 2 percent objective. Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to2 percent. As I indicated, a better forward-looking measure of inflation, core inflation—that’snot our target, but I think it’s worth looking at because it’s a better forward-looking predictor ofheadline inflation—I think that’s still running a little bit under 2 percent, but we expect it’s goingto move up to 2. And this seemed like a good time to remind Americans that what our objectiveis is 2 percent inflation. Inflation is not always going to be at 2 percent. It’s—like all economicvariables, it fluctuates. Sometimes it’s going to be below 2 percent, sometimes it’s going to beabove 2 percent. We’ve had a long period in which inflation has run under 2 percent. As wemove back to 2 percent, which is where we’re heading, there will be some times when it’s above2 percent as well. And it’s a reminder—2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, it’s a target. It’swhere we always want inflation to be heading. And there will be some times when inflation isabove 2 percent, just like it’s been below 2 percent. We’re not shooting for inflation above2 percent, but it’s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we’reachieving our objective.

JEANNA SMIALEK. How well can you tolerate an overshoot?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, we would—if there were an overshoot and it appeared to bepersistent, we would put in place policies to try to bring inflation back to 2 percent. That’s thecore set of principles that we have adopted in our statement on longer-run goals and strategy.And exactly how long it would take to get back to 2 percent would depend, in part, on what washappening with respect to employment and our other objectives. So there’s no hard and fastanswer to that.March 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

PATRICK GILLESPIE. Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN. Some fiscal policyproposals, such as the border adjustment tax, would cause the dollar to strengthen significantlyover a short period of time. I realize you can’t comment on the specific policy proposal, but ifthe dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, perhaps some 20 percent forwhatever reason, what would—what do you think the impact would be on the U.S. economy,particularly in exports and manufacturing? And what do you think would be any implicationsfor U.S. monetary policy?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So that’s a—that’s a difficult question to answer. You asked thatquestion not in an isolated way: What would the impact of a large appreciation of the dollar be?But, as I understand it, you asked about it in the context of a border tax adjustment. Is that right?Because the argument that is made is that what a border tax would do without an exchange rateadjustment is to raise the price of imported goods into the United States. And that largemovement in the dollar that analysts claim would occur would essentially—if it were complete,would fully offset the impact of the border tax on U.S. import goods. So, it wouldn’t end uphaving an impact on U.S. inflation or GDP growth.But a question that’s a very different—that’s a very different matter than if, suddenly, forsome reason, the dollar were simply to begin appreciating by a large amount, say, because therewere flight-to-safety flows into the dollar. I mean, if—if the latter were to occur, there were justa big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downward pressure on inflation and would have anegative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports. But that’s a, that’s a different—that’s a different exercise. I would just say, it’s very uncertain exactly what would happen to thedollar. There has been a lot of discussion of that, and I think it’s complicated and uncertain.March 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Yellen. Victoria Guida with Politico. My question isabout Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee wrote to you asking that the Fednot put forward any regulations until a Vice Chair of Supervision is in place. So I have a coupleof questions about that. One is, are you all pulling back at all on any regulations—maybe not allregulations, but, you know, maybe only going forward with ones that you see as more timesensitive? And during the hearing before that committee, you mentioned specifically the CCARstress-test rule would have to come out sometime before that next cycle. Are there any othertime-sensitive regulations?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So at this point we don’t have a lot of time-sensitive regulations.There is nothing right now that we need to get out that’s a significant rule. So we have arelatively light regulatory agenda at this point. We recognize, of course, that we do have anobligation to write the rules that Congress, you know, dictates in laws that they pass, and so thatis an ongoing obligation—obligation that we have. But our calendar is relatively light at thispoint.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Some Fed critics have said it’s too soon to raiseinterest rates because wages haven’t risen enough to justify a rate increase. What would you sayto that?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I don’t—I would like to see wages increase and think there’ssome scope for them to increase somewhat further. But our objectives are maximumemployment and inflation, and we need to consider what path of rates is appropriate to fosterMarch 15, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALthose objectives. Unfortunately, one of the things that’s been holding down wage increases isvery slow productivity growth. And I think we are seeing some upward pressure as the laborobjectives. But productivity is—for those focusing on wage growth, productivity is an additionalimportant factor.
