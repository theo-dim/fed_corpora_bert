CHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Today, the Federal Open Market Committeemaintained the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent. This accommodativepolicy should support further progress toward our statutory objectives of maximum employmentand price stability. Based on the economic outlook, the Committee continues to anticipate thatgradual increases in the federal funds rate over time are likely to be consistent with achievingand maintaining our objectives. However, recent economic indicators have been mixed,suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate. Asalways, our policy is not on a preset course, and if the economic outlook shifts, the appropriatepath of policy will shift correspondingly. I will come back to our policy decision, but first I willreview recent economic developments and the outlook.Economic growth was relatively weak late last year and early this year. Some of thefactors weighing on growth were expected. For example, exports have been soft, reflectingsubdued foreign demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar. Also, activity in the energysector has obviously been hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014. But theslowdown in other parts of the economy was not expected. In particular, business investmentoutside of energy was particularly weak during the winter and appears to have remained so intothe spring. In addition, growth in household spending slowed noticeably early in the year despitesolid increases in household income as well as relatively high levels of consumer sentiment andwealth. Fortunately, the first-quarter slowdown in household spending appears to have beentemporary; indicators for the second quarter have so far pointed to a sizable rebound. Thisrecovery is a key factor supporting the Committee’s expectation that overall economic activitywill expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALDespite lackluster economic growth, the job market continued to improve early in theyear. During the first quarter, job gains averaged nearly 200,000 per month, just a bit slowerthan last year’s pace. And the unemployment rate held near 5 percent even though notably morepeople were actively looking for work. However, more recently the pace of improvement in thelabor market appears to have slowed markedly. Job gains in April and May are estimated tohave averaged only about 80,000 per month. And while the unemployment rate fell to4.7 percent in May, that decline occurred because fewer people reported that they were activelyseeking work. A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and areavailable to work but have not searched recently as well as people who are working part time butwould rather work full time has flattened out. On a more positive note, average hourly earningsincreased 2½ percent over the past 12 months—a bit faster than in earlier years and a welcomeindication that wage growth may finally be picking up. Although recent labor market data have,on balance, been disappointing, it’s important not to overreact to one or two monthly readings.The Committee continues to expect that the labor market will strengthen further over the nextfew years. That said, we will be watching the job market carefully.Ongoing economic growth and an improving labor market underpin our inflation outlook.Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumptionexpenditures—was about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, still short of our2 percent objective. Much of this shortfall continues to reflect the effects of earlier declines inenergy prices and lower prices for imports. Core inflation, which excludes energy and foodprices, has been running close to 1½ percent. As the transitory influences holding down inflationfade, and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to2 percent over the next two to three years.June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALOur inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment that longer-run inflationexpectations remain reasonably well anchored. However, we can’t take the stability of longerrun inflation expectations for granted. While most survey measures of longer-run inflationexpectations show little change, on balance, in recent months, financial market measures ofinflation compensation have declined. Movements in these indicators reflect many factors andtherefore may not provide an accurate reading on changes in the inflation expectations that aremost relevant for wages and prices. Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we willcontinue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.Let me now turn to the individual economic projections submitted for this meeting byFOMC participants. As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her ownview of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depends on each person’s assessment of themultitude of factors that shape the outlook. Participants’ projections for growth of inflationadjusted gross domestic product are slightly lower in the near term than the projections made forthe March FOMC meeting. The median growth projection now remains at 2 percent through2018, in line with its estimated longer-run rate. The median projection for the unemploymentrate edges down from 4.7 percent at the end of this year to 4.6 percent in the next two years,somewhat below the median assessment of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. Themedian path of the unemployment rate is little changed from March. Finally, the medianinflation projection stands at 1.4 percent this year, a bit firmer than in March, and then rises to1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018.Returning to monetary policy, as I said, the Committee maintained its target range for thefederal funds rate. This decision reflects the Committee’s careful approach in setting monetarypolicy, particularly in light of the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth that IJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALhave discussed as well as continuing below-target inflation. Proceeding cautiously in raising ourinterest rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace,that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progresstoward our 2 percent objective. Caution is all the more appropriate given that short-term interestrates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy can more effectively respond tosurprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future than to a weakening labor market andfalling inflation.Although the financial market stresses that emanated from abroad at the start of this yearhave eased, vulnerabilities in the global economy remain. In the current environment of sluggishglobal growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in manyadvanced economies, investor perceptions of, and appetite for, risk can change abruptly. As ourstatement notes, we will continue to closely monitor global economic and financialdevelopments.We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradualincreases in the federal funds rate. We expect the rate to remain, for some time, below levelsthat are anticipated to prevail in the longer run because headwinds weighing on the economymean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low byhistorical standards. These headwinds—which include developments abroad, subduedhousehold formation, and meager productivity growth—could persist for some time. But, if theygradually fade over the next few years as we expect, then the interest rate required to keep theeconomy operating at an even keel should move higher as well.This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1½ percent at the end ofJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALnext year and 2½ percent by the end of 2018, somewhat below its estimated longer-run normallevel. Although the median federal funds rate at the end of this year is unchanged from March, anumber of participants revised down their projections. For 2017 and 2018, the median projectionis ¼ to ½ percentage point lower than in March, roughly in line with the ¼ percentage pointdownward revision made to the estimated longer-run level of the federal funds rate.As I have noted on previous occasions, participants’ projections for the federal funds rate,including the median path, are not a fixed plan for future policy. Policy is not on a preset course.These forecasts represent participants’ individual assessments of appropriate policy given theirprojections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors. However, theeconomic outlook is inherently uncertain, so each participant’s assessment of appropriate policyis also necessarily uncertain, especially at longer time horizons, and will change in response tochanges to the economic outlook and associated risks.Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturingTreasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.As highlighted in our policy statement, we anticipate continuing this policy until normalizationof the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. Maintaining our sizable holdings oflonger-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and shouldreduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a futurelarge adverse shock.Thank you, I will be happy to take your questions.

SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. One ofthe big uncertainties hanging over markets right now is clearly the vote in the United Kingdomnext week. How much of a factor was that in today’s decision, relative to the questions you’veJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALelucidated about, the domestic jobs numbers and inflation data? And could you talk a little bitabout the channels that you think about when you talk about the potential impact of a Brexit onthe U.S. economy? Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, Brexit, the upcoming U.K. decision on whether or not to leavethe European Union, is something we discussed, and I think it’s fair to say that it was one of thefactors that factored into today’s decisions—clearly this is a very important decision for theUnited Kingdom and for Europe. It is a decision that could have consequences for economic andfinancial conditions in global financial markets. If it does so, it could have consequences in turnfor the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path ofpolicy. So it is certainly one of the uncertainties that we discussed and that factored intotoday’s decision.

STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. The Fed’s outlook for rates has come down sharply for2018 especially, but it’s been coming down gradually over time—almost a full percentage pointin some cases, compared to a year ago—and yet the GDP outlook remains the same. What hashappened in, say, just the past quarter to the Committee’s outlook for rates to bring it down somuch for, say, 2018, where it’s now just 2.4 percent and further from the long run than it was,say, in the prior estimate that was out there? Has there been a dramatic change in theCommittee’s view on the relationship of GDP to rates? And maybe you could also explain whythe Fed has to keep lowering these rates and getting that forecast wrong.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there is really a great dealof uncertainty around each individual’s assessment of the appropriate level of rates, particularlyas we go further out in the forecast horizon and when we come to the long term. And I thinkwhat we can see, and what many econometric and other studies show, is that the so-called neutralJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALrate—namely, the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growingroughly at trend and operating near full employment—that rate is quite depressed by historicalstandards. Many estimates would put it, in real or inflation-adjusted terms, near zero.Now, the path that you see in the dot plot for rates over time is importantlyinfluenced—there is accommodation, and as we achieve our objectives, I think most participantsfeel that the accommodation in the current stance of policy needs to be gradually removed, but avery important influence in the out years is, what will happen to that neutral rate that will justkeep the economy operating on an even keel? And I’ve often in my statements and remarkstalked about headwinds that reflect lingering effects of the financial crisis; to the extent that thereare headwinds, I think many of us expect that these headwinds would gradually diminish overtime, and that’s a reason why you see the upward path for rates.But there are also more long-lasting or persistent factors that may be at work that areholding down the longer-run level of neutral rates—for example, slow productivity growth,which is not just a U.S. phenomenon but a global phenomenon. You know, obviously, there is alot of uncertainty about what will happen to productivity growth, but productivity growth couldstay long for a prolonged time, and we have an aging—aging societies in many parts of the worldthat could depress this neutral rate. 1 And I think all of us are involved in a process of constantlyreevaluating where is that neutral rate going, and I think what you see is a downward shift in thatassessment over time, the sense that maybe more of what’s causing this neutral rate to be low arefactors that are not going to be rapidly disappearing but will be part of the new normal. Now,1Chair Yellen intended to say, “You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen toproductivity growth, but productivity growth could stay low for a prolonged time, and we have an aging—agingsocieties in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate.”June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALyou still see an assessment that that neutral rate will move up somewhat, but it has been comingdown, and I think it continues to be marked lower. And it is highly uncertain, for all of the dots.

JASON LANGE. Hi, I’m Jason Lange with Reuters. The median participant forecast forthe fed funds rate for 2017 and 2018 came down quite dramatically, but this stands in contrastwith the 2016 meeting forecast. As you mentioned, there were a number—actually, six—participants who saw only one rate hike this year. Can you comment on what it would take fortwo rate increases to be a—the likely or appropriate policy path? And about this disconnectbetween the median view and the view of the, say, the voting members of the Committee? Ifthere is one, I should add. Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I’m not going to comment on participants versus voters. Youknow, monetary policy—the Committee feels that monetary policy—when we are looking atseveral years, we should show the public what the views are of all the participants in theCommittee, especially given that voting—voting rotates every year, and so that’s a decision wemade.But you asked me what it would take to have two increases. So, you know, theCommittee as a whole never discusses, how many increases should we have this year or nextyear—that’s not a decision we’re making as a Committee. We’re making decisions on ameeting-by-meeting basis and trying to give a sense to the public of what we’re looking for andwhat the basis of a decision will be. And, as I indicated, first of all, international uncertaintiesloom large here; we mentioned Brexit, the U.K. decision, obviously how that turns out issomething that will factor into future decisions. And we’re also looking at the prospects foreconomic growth and continued progress in the labor market. The forecast that you see in theJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALgrowth, 2 percent growth—so, you know, suggests healthy growth for the rest of the year and apickup in growth in the second quarter, and we expect to see continuing progress in thelabor market.Now, we had questions about the growth outlook because we did see slower growth inthe fourth quarter and in the first quarter. I have to say there, with respect to the slowdown wesaw in consumer spending, that seemed to be out of line with fundamentals. We expected it topick up, and we’ve seen very good evidence that it has picked up. But now, the labor marketappears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum inthe economy has not diminished. So, as I said, we will be carefully assessing data on the laborimprovement in the labor market. And we will be watching the spending data to make suregrowth is picking up in line with our expectations.Of course, with respect to inflation, we’re constantly evaluating whether or notincoming information is roughly in line with our expectations. So we will be evaluating that atevery meeting; every meeting is live, and we could make a decision at any meeting to adjust thefunds rate, but that’s the kind of thing that we will want to see to make such decisions.

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. The Fed created a labor market conditions index a coupleof years ago that was designed to sort of bring together a lot of these factors in the labor marketthat you’ve talked about. As I’m sure you know, it’s been falling since January. That suggeststo some people that it was your decision to raise rates in December that has caused thisweakening in the labor market. Could you address what role, if any, you think the Fed’s decisionto raise rates has played in the slowdown we are now seeing?June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, let me just say the labor market conditions index is a kind ofexperimental research product that’s a summary measure of many different indicators, and,essentially, that measure tries to assess the change in the labor market conditions. As I look at it,and as that index looks at things, the state of the labor market is still healthy, but there’s beensomething of a loss of momentum: The 200,000 jobs a month we saw, for example, in the firstquarter of the year, that’s slowed in recent months.Exactly what the reasons are for that slowing, it’s difficult to say. It may turn out—youknow, again, we should never pay too much attention to, for example, one job market report.There’s a large error around that, we often see large revisions, we should not overblow thesignificance of one data point, especially when other indicators of the labor market are stillflashing green: Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain low; perceptions of the laborthere’s a good deal of incoming data that does signal continued progress and strength in the laborSo, the Committee doesn’t feel and doesn’t expect, and I don’t expect, that laborpublic and through our actions and through the revisions you see—have seen over time in the dotplot—that we do not have a fixed plan for raising rates over time. We look at incoming data andare prepared to adjust our views to keep the economy on track, and, in light of that datadependence of our policy, I really don’t think that a single rate increase of 25 basis points inour thinking in light of incoming data in whatever direction is appropriate.June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

JON HILSENRATH. Chair Yellen, I want to come back to these longer-run rateprojections that you’ve been asked about. So, yields on 10-year Treasury notes have fallenbelow 1.6 percent; on 5-year notes, they’re near 1 percent. Elsewhere in the world, in Germanyand Japan, long-term bond yields are negative. Does—how do you explain this low level oflong-term bond yields? And does it give you any pause in looking at your own projections andcoming to a conclusion about whether those projections are possibly still way too high when thebond market is at a much lower level?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I think the levels of longer-term rates reflect essentially twothings. One is market expectations about the path of short-term rates over, if we’re considering,say, a 10-year Treasury security, what would be the path of short-term rates over the next10 years. And the second factor is the so-called term premium, or the extra yield that investorsdemand in order to hold a longer-term security instead of to invest short term. And clearly,and that is a factor. That is an important factor that’s, I think, holding down the level of longerterm yields. But, perhaps as important, or maybe even more important, the term premium is alsolow and has probably come down. Now, when we engaged in longer-term asset purchases, ourvery purpose in doing that was to drive down longer-term yields by making these assets scarce—scarcer and, hence, more valuable to the public that wants to invest in long-term securities, andwe were consciously attempting to drive down that term premium.Now, we continue to hold a large quantity of those securities, but we’re not adding tothem. But, in many parts of the world—the ECB, for example, and the Bank of Japan are alsoengaging in quantitative easing, buying longer-term assets and pushing down those term premia.So I think term premia are very low as well as the expected path of short rates.June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH. Do these yield levels give you any uncertainty, any doubt aboutwhether—are you going to be able to get rates to where projections say they’re going?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, so I want to say again, we’re quite uncertain about where ratesare heading in the longer term. We write down our best estimates at this time of what is alonger-run normal level of the federal funds rate, and those are numbers about which there isgreat uncertainty. As I said, we have good reason to believe that the so-called neutral rate or ratecompatible with the economy operating at full employment is low at the present time. And manyof us believe, as a base case, it’s reasonable to assume that those rates will move up over time,but we’re not certain of that. It is—it’s one of the uncertainties that—and there could berevisions in either direction, but thus far, in recent SEPs, I’d say the revisions have mainlybeen—have been in the downward direction. The idea that a low neutral rate may be more—closer to the new normal, but you still do see some reversion. So we’re really quite uncertainabout that.

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI. In your speech in Philadelphia, you called the slowdown in job growth lastmonth “concerning,” and you mentioned today that you want to verify that the underlyingmomentum in the economy and in the labor market is still continuing. What do you need to seeto convince you that the labor market is still moving toward full employment, and for how longwould you need to see it?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I can’t give you a formula, I know you would probably like tohave a number that’s a cutoff for what we need to see in a particular report. There are a lot ofdifferent indicators of the labor market—for example, the labor market conditions index thatBinya referred to has 19 different indicators. Clearly, we will be looking at the next job report,and if we were to see a healthy pace of job growth, you know, above that needed to kind ofJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALmaintain the status quo in the labor market. So, you know, I should say, over time, we shouldexpect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of jobgains is probably going to slow down somewhat. And we have seen some slowing. But therecent couple of months was very low and, arguably, not even at the pace we need to see tomaintain stable labor market conditions. So we want to see an adequate pace of job creation.There might be revisions to previous months that would change our views, but there will be othersurveys of employment intentions and other indicators of the labor market that we’ll focus—we’ll be focusing on. So, there is no formula for what it takes, but we will be looking at thelabor market. Did you want to follow up?

[SECTION]

YLAN MUI. Sorry, I had a quick follow-up. Also in your speech in Philadelphia, youdid not say that you felt that it would be probably appropriate for a rate hike to occur in thecoming months. Do you—did you intentionally leave that out?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. You know, we do need to make sure that there is sufficientmomentum. I don’t know what the timetable is going to be to gain that assurance. Everymeeting is live; there is no meeting that is off the table, that—no meeting is out in terms of apossible rate increase. But, we really need to look at the data, and I can’t prespecify a timetable.So I’m, you know, not comfortable to say it’s in the next meeting or two, but it could be, it couldbe, it’s not impossible. It’s not impossible that by July, for example, we would see data that ledus to believe that we’re on a perfectly fine course, and that data was an aberration, and otherconcerns would have passed.

PETER BARNES. Ma’am, Peter Barnes, Fox Business. Hi. We are in an electionseason, and in the past, the Fed has been sensitive to making policy changes in election years.You have three more meetings before the November presidential election. Could you commentJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALon whether or not the election will come into play, and any concern that if you change policyahead of the election and, based on your forecast today, you obviously could—are you concernedthat that could then lead to charges that the Fed is trying to change policy to influence theoutcome of the election, because the Fed has been sensitive to that in the past? Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So we are very focused on assessing the economic outlook andmaking changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account. Look, if the data—incoming data were, in the coming months, to justify the kind of gradual increases that we havelong discussed, that we see as appropriate in light of the outlook, I think markets should not besurprised by such a decision if we make it. And it’s obviously consistent with the data thatwe’ve seen, and the Committee will feel free to move in the coming months if we think it’sappropriate.

[SECTION]

JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg. You mentioned in your remarks atthe beginning that we are getting a slightly different signal when you look at inflation versuswhen you look at inflation expectations. Could you detail a little bit which you look at and sortof weight more? Are you more concerned with the inflation expectations or focusing more onthe slight pickup in actual inflation?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, we’re looking at both. You know, I would say, with respect tothe behavior of inflation, inflation is behaving roughly in the manner I would have expected; Ihave really not seen significant surprises there. We’ve long said that an important reason thatinflation is as low as it’s been is because of past declines in energy prices and increases in thevalue of the dollar, and as those factors began to dissipate, we would see inflation moving up.Now, that’s exactly what we’re seeing, what we’re—that’s in line with our thinking and with thedata. So, those things have stabilized, their influence is dissipating.June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALAnd with respect to core inflation, which—now, that’s partly influenced also by thedollar, but trying to pull out the dollar and import price influence—core inflation seems to bebehaving roughly as one would expect with well-anchored inflation expectations and inimproving labor markets. So I’m not seeing anything—inflation, even core inflation, is runningunder 2 percent. I continue to think the evidence supports a projection that it will move up overthe next couple of years back toward our 2 percent objective. But, we’ve seen in the past, andeconomic theory suggests, that inflation expectations are relevant to price and wage settingNow, it’s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actualprice and wage decisions. And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure ofhousehold inflation expectations, move down. It’s hard—that’s a preliminary number, it’s hardto know what to make of it. We’ve certainly taken note of it. But survey-based measures that—where forecasters are queried—have really all been quite stable. And measures of inflationcompensation—I always try to be careful to call it “inflation compensation” rather than“inflation expectations” because they’re not inflation expectations. Inflation expectationsinfluence those market measures, but there’s also an inflation risk premium. And there areactually good reasons to think that the inflation risk premium could have declined significantlyand may be depressing those measures. So we watch them, we’ve taken note in the statementthat they’ve moved down, but actual inflation is behaving more or less as would be expected.minutes were released, they caught markets by surprise. In there, they showed—they seemed toshow that there was an active discussion of a possible June rate increase, something that wehadn’t gotten from the policy statement that was issued right after the meeting. Was that aJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALconscious decision to hold back and tell us in—when the minutes came out about the Junediscussion? And if so, could you tell us what surprises we could see in the June minutes?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So the minutes are always—have to be an accurate discussion ofwhat happened at the meeting. So they’re not changed after the fact in order to correct possiblemisconceptions. There was a good deal of discussion at that meeting of the possibility ofmoving in June, and that appeared in the minutes.I suppose in the April statement, we gave no obvious hint or kind of calendar-basedsignal that June was a possibility. But I think if you look at the statement, we pointed to slowergrowth but pointed out that the fundamentals—there was no obvious fundamental reason forgrowth to have slowed. And we pointed to fundamentals underlying household spendingthat would disappear. We noted that labor market conditions continued to improve in line withour expectations, and we did downgrade somewhat our expressions of concern about the globalrisk environment. So I do think that there were hints in the April statement that the Committeewas changing its views of what it was seeing in a direction. We continue to say that we think, ifeconomic developments evolve in line with our expectations, the gradual and cautious furtherincreases we expect to be appropriate. And I suppose I was somewhat surprised with the marketinterpretation of it. But the June meeting minutes—the minutes of the April meeting were anaccurate summary of what had happened.

JEREMY TORDJMAN. Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP news agency. The Fed hasrepeatedly voiced its concern over the slow pace of wage growth, and I was wondering, do youthink that increasing the federal minimum wage could be of any help? Could it boost the higherwages and eventually drive up the inflation?June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I think that the minimum wage increases that have gone intoeffect—estimates that I’ve seen suggest it’s a relatively minor influence on the aggregate level ofwage inflation. I would take somewhat faster wage increases to be a sign that labor market slackis diminishing and that the labor market is approaching conditions that are consistent withmaximum employment. So, I think, you know, I think we have seen some hints, perhapspreliminary indications, that wage growth is picking up. And as much as anything, I think it’s asign of a generally healthy labor market, which is what our mandated objective is, to achievemaximum employment. And so it would be a symptom of it.

GREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. There’s been a lot of discussion in lastcouple months about the slow pace of demand in the global economy, and some economiststhink that central banks should think about using helicopter money, maybe in Japan first orEurope first. But then, former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke weighed in saying that he thought itwould be a good thing for the Fed to put helicopter money in its toolkit in case there was adownturn in the United States. So I’d like to get your comments on that.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, in normal times, I think it’s very important that there be acentral bank. We have seen all too many examples of countries that end up with high or evenhyperinflation because those in charge of fiscal policy direct their central bank to help themfinance it by printing money, and maintaining price stability and low and stable inflation is verymuch aided by having central bank independence.Now, that said, in unusual times where the concern is with very weak growth or possiblydeflation—rather rare circumstances—first of all, fiscal policy can be a very important tool. Andit’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try toJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALstimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role. And normally, you would hope, in aneconomy with those severe downside risks, monetary and fiscal policy would not be working atcross purposes to get—but together.Now, whether or not in such extreme circumstances, there might be a case for, let’s say,coordination—close coordination, with the central bank playing a role in financing fiscal policy;this is something that academics are debating, and it is something that one might legitimatelyconsider. I would see this as a very abnormal, extreme situation where one needs an all-outattempt, and even then it’s a matter that academics are debating, but only in an unusual situation.

JUSTINE UNDERHILL. Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance. So now that the Fed hasstarted the process of raising rates, various Fed officials have said, including Ben Bernanke, thatthe Fed could go cash flow negative in this scenario as capital losses are taken on the portfolio ofbonds. Do you still see this happening, and when might this happen?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So you’re talking about our income going negative?

[SECTION]

JUSTINE UNDERHILL. Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, it is conceivable in a scenario when—where growth andinflation really surprise us to the upside that we would have to raise short-term interest rates sorapidly that the rates we would be paying on reserves would exceed what we’re earning on ourportfolio. Now even then, we have about $2 trillion of liabilities, namely currency on which wepay no interest. So this does requires an extreme scenario with very rapid increases in short-terminterest rates. So it is conceivable but quite unlikely that it could happen.But, you know, if it were to happen, we would have an economy that would be doingvery well. This is probably an economy that everybody would feel very pleased—wasperforming well and better than expected, and where monetary policy—you know, our goal isJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALprice stability and maximum employment, and we would probably feel that we had done verywell in achieving that. So, we usually make money—we’ve been making a lot of money inrecent years, but the goal of monetary policy is not to maximize our income. And, you know, ina very strong economy like that, the Treasury would be seeing a lot of inflows in the form of taxrevenues, too.

STEVE BECKNER. Madam Chair, Steve Beckner of Market News International. Towhat extent do you feel constrained in raising interest rates by the low or even negative rates thatforeign central banks are pursuing, possibly out of concern for what it might mean for the dollarexchange rate? And, if that is a constraint, to what extent are you—might you also be concernedabout the impact, long range, of low domestic rates on possibly distorting domestic markets?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So the state of foreign economies, both their growth outlooks and thestance of monetary policy, those are factors that influence the U.S. outlook and influence theappropriate stance of monetary policy. So, of course, we do look at foreign rates, theprospects—and the prospects for growth in those economies in considering the stance of policy.Differentials between countries in likely policy paths do tend to spill over into exchangerates—that is a standard part of how monetary policy works—and a stronger dollar, those have aboth—a depressing effect. It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed. Atthe moment, net exports—well, for quite some time and probably going forward, they will besomewhat of a drag on U.S. growth, so that’s a factor that we take into account. And increasesin the dollar that we’ve seen since mid-2014 have served to push inflation down as well; it canalso have impacts on commodity prices that are relevant.So, it’s—it is certainly relevant to the stance of U.S. monetary policy and a factor, butwhen one says “a constraint,” I really would not go so far as to say it is a constraint on monetaryJune 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALpolicy. When we have an outlook for continuing above-trend growth—that if we held ratesabsolutely flat, we have reason to believe inflation would overshoot our target—we would see acase to gradually raise rates over time. At the moment, I think markets do expect, and this isfactored into market prices, a gradual path for rates to increase over time.But, for example, if we were to see upside surprises to growth and to inflation and had toraise short-term rates faster, thought we should, one of the channels by which that would workwould be the associated impact on the dollar. That is a standard channel through which themonetary policy transmission mechanism works, and we would take it into account and wouldnot feel constrained, but that would be part of how it would work.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. How much do you—oh, Nancy Marshall-Genzerfrom Marketplace. How much are you watching oil prices and their impact on inflation, and howthat could affect the timing of future rate increases and how much you might increase rates?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, oil prices have had many different effects on the economy, andso we’ve been watching oil prices closely. As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.You know, it takes falling oil prices to lower inflation on a sustained basis. Once they stabilizeat whatever level, their impact on inflation dissipates over time. So we’re beginning to see thathappening. Not only have they stabilized, they have moved up some, and their inflation is—theirimpact on inflation is waning over time. But oil prices have also had a very substantial negativeeffect on drilling and mining activity that’s led to weakness in investment spending and job lossin manufacturing and, obviously, in the energy sector.Now, you know, it has different effects in different countries and different sectors. ForAmerican households, it’s been a boon. We’ve estimated that since mid-2014, the decline inenergy prices and oil prices has probably resulted in gains of about $1,400 per U.S. household,June 15, 2016Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALand that’s had an offsetting positive impact on spending. But in many countries around theworld that are important commodity exporters, the decline we’ve seen in oil prices has had adepressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and causedproblems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well. So it’s a complicated picture.
