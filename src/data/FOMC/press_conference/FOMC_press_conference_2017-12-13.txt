CHAIR YELLEN. Good afternoon. Today the Federal Open Market Committee decidedto raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1¼ to1½ percent. Our decision reflects our assessment that a gradual removal of monetary policyaccommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to usby law. Before saying more about our decision, I’ll review recent economic developments andthe outlook.Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth stepped up to a solid3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year. Household spending has beenexpanding at a moderate rate, business investment has picked up, and favorable economicconditions abroad have supported exports. Overall, we continue to expect that the economy willexpand at a moderate pace. While changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift toeconomic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects ofany tax package remain uncertain.Smoothing through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains averaged 170,000 per monthover the three months ending in November, well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorbnew entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate has declined further in recent monthsand, at 4.1 percent in November, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’estimates of its longer-run normal level. Broader measures of labor market utilization have alsocontinued to strengthen. Participation in the labor force has changed little, on net, over the pastfour years. Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from theaging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improvedDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALconditions in the labor market. We expect that the job market will remain strong in the yearsahead.You may have noticed that we altered the statement language about the labor marketoutlook. This change highlights that the Committee expects the labor market to remain strong,with sustained job creation, ample opportunities for workers, and rising wages. We anticipatesome further strengthening in labor market conditions in the months ahead; however, we expectthe pace of job gains to moderate over time as we gradually reduce the degree of monetarypolicy accommodation. Allowing the labor market to overheat would raise the risk thatmonetary policy would need to tighten abruptly at a later stage, jeopardizing the economicexpansion.Even with a firming of economic growth and a stronger labor market, inflation hascontinued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objective. The 12-month change in theprice index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent in October, up a bit from thesummer but still below rates seen earlier in the year. Core inflation—which excludes the volatilefood and energy categories—has followed a similar pattern and was 1.4 percent in October. Wecontinue to believe that this year’s surprising softness in inflation primarily reflects transitorydevelopments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions. As a result, we stillexpect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years.Nonetheless, as I’ve noted previously, our understanding of the forces driving inflation isimperfect. As emphasized in our statement, we will carefully monitor actual and expectedinflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal. And, as I’ve noted before, weare prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve our inflation and employmentobjectives over the medium term.December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALLet me turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for thismeeting. As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views ofappropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant’s assessment of themany factors that shape the outlook. The median projection for growth of inflation-adjustedgross domestic product, or real GDP, is 2½ percent this year and next and moderates to 2 percentby 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate. The median projection for the unemploymentrate stands at 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs close to 4 percent over thenext three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer-run normal rate. Finally, themedian inflation projection is 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019and 2020. Compared with the projections made in September, real GDP growth is a littlestronger, the unemployment rate is a bit lower, and inflation is essentially unchanged.Participants generally identified changes in tax policy as a factor supporting this modestlystronger outlook, although many noted that much uncertainty remains about the macroeconomiceffects of the specific measures that ultimately may be implemented.Returning to monetary policy, for the past two years the FOMC has been graduallyincreasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy has continued to makeprogress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. Our decision todaycontinues this process.We still expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases inthe federal funds rate. That expectation is based on our view that this rate remains somewhatbelow its neutral level—that is, the level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary andkeeps the economy operating on an even keel. Because the neutral rate currently appears to bequite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further toDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALget to a neutral policy stance. But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal fundsrate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over thenext few years to sustain a strong labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percentlonger-run objective. Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer-run neutrallevel of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of next year, 2.7 percentat the end of 2019, and 3.1 percent in 2020. Compared with the projections made in September,the median path for the federal funds rate is unchanged through 2019 and a touch higher in 2020.I should note that the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjusttheir assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as their economic outlooksand views of the risks to the outlook change. Policy is not on a preset course.Additionally, the Committee’s balance sheet normalization program, initiated in October,is proceeding. As we’ve noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate isour primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and we do not foresee a need toalter our balance sheet normalization program. Hence, our statement no longer mentions thisprogram. Of course, we would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material deterioration inthe economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.Finally, I’d like to note that, although I have one more FOMC meeting to attend in theNew Year, this will be my last scheduled news conference. Over the next month and a half, Iwill do my utmost to ensure a smooth transition to my designated successor, Jay Powell. I amconfident that he is as deeply committed as I have been to the Federal Reserve’s vital publicDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALmission. Thank you for being such an attentive audience these past four years. And, as always,I’ll be happy to take your questions.could you give us any insight into the discussion and how it dealt with the major tax changes thatCongress is considering now? There have been thoughts that with these changes happening at atime when the economy is already—with unemployment so low—that the Fed may be forced toincrease its pace on rate hikes. Did any of that discussion come up in your meeting?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, yes, we did discuss tax policy, and let me say that most of mycolleagues factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus along the lines of what’s beingcontemplated by Congress into their projections. Now, I should emphasize that some have beenincorporating those expectations into their projections throughout the year, so changes to theprojections that you see since September should not be viewed as an impact—an estimate of theimpact of the tax package. And, in particular, broader expectations of changes to fiscal policyhave been reflected in financial market conditions, I think, over the past year. For example, wehave seen a significant increase in the stock market, and at least some portion of that, I wouldjudge, likely partly reflected expected tax changes, and that effect—along with other financialaffected wealth—that’s been part of participants’ forecasts now for some time. I think mycolleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type oftax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growthin the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of the reasons, I think, for the uptickyou see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rate.December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALThe views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a wide range of analysis,including that of the Joint Committee on Taxation and other outside evaluators, and my sense isthat their estimates are essentially in the same ballpark, although they recognize, as Iemphasized, that there is considerable uncertainty about the impacts, and that will have to bemonitored over time. More specifically, they tend to see the package as boosting both consumerspending and capital spending, to some extent.Now, to the extent that the changes do have positive impact on the growth of potentialGDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is something that, should it occur, would bevery welcome to participants, as long as it’s consistent with the attainment of our employmentand inflation objectives. I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at theprojections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, alteredthe outlook for growth and inflation. All of that factors into the projections you see.But I think, bottom line, when you look at assessments of the funds rate path, participantscontinue to see gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate as beingappropriate to sustain a strong labor market and bring inflation back to 2 percent. And, look—importantly, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likely effects will be, and my colleaguesand I will be committed, as always, to evaluating incoming data and altering the outlook asappropriate.

[SECTION]

HARRIET TORRY. Harriet Torry with Dow Jones Newswires. You and others at theFed have said that soft inflation should be transitory. Are you confident that that will still be thecase, particularly regarding wage gains? They’ve been pretty moderate in recent months, yet theDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALeconomy is growing and confidence is high. Is there something going on in the economy that’smaking it difficult for businesses to raise wages?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So it is true that incoming wage data suggests only modest upwardpressure on wages. That leaves me—that’s one factor, along with the fact that inflation remainslow—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, that the laborreflects slow productivity growth. But when you ask me about the outlook for inflation, youknow, I’ve talked in detail about this in the past and recognize that there is uncertainty aboutwhat’s holding inflation down. But my colleagues and I continue to believe that the factors thatare responsible this year for holding inflation down are likely to prove transitory. That said, weall agree that our inflation objective is extremely important. We recognize that there’s been aprolonged shortfall. This is a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we continue toindicate that we’ll be monitoring inflation developments closely. And so this is on the horizonand recognized to be one of the risks facing policy.

[SECTION]

NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Yellen, Iwanted to follow up on the question about tax changes. When you addressed it earlier today, andwhen you spoke to Congress last month, you often describe that you would welcome highergrowth in the context of the employment and inflation mandate. And I guess I wonder how youjudge the major provisions of the House and Senate tax plans: the corporate rate cut, immediateexpensing of big-ticket purchases, new rates for pass-throughs, temporary rate cuts forindividuals. Do you see those, on balance, boosting the productive capacity of the U.S. economyas opposed to simply increasing aggregate demand? And, related to that, how would you viewDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALthe benefit of such tax changes now, when the economy is nearing full employment, versus atearlier periods when there was greater resource slack?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the likely tax package asboosting aggregate demand, but also having some potential to boost aggregate supply. Sochanges on the corporate tax side—the reduction in the corporate tax rate, expensing—will lowerthe cost of capital. And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how muchstimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would see some stimulus to investment.In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of investment could boost capitalformation and thereby raise productivity growth and potential GDP or output to some extent.Exactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain, but that is a channel. And I supposeit’s also possible—I’m uncertain how significant this would be—that lower marginal effectivetax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor supply. And, again, there are arange of estimates in the literatures.I indicated I think participants have reviewed a number of pieces of analysis, includingthe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, and the many outside analysts who have weighed inon this and been influenced by that kind of analysis—but there is a good deal of uncertaintyabout what the impacts would be. And, to the extent that there are larger impacts than thoseanalyses assume on aggregate supply or potential GDP, in the context of an economy that hashad disturbingly low productivity growth, that would be welcome and could support faster GDPgrowth, at least for some period, without—you know, without creating a need to tightenmonetary policy to offset that.So there are potentially both demand and supply effects here. So, importantly, you reallydon’t, at the end of the day, see very much change in the federal funds rate path. Participants doDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALrecognize that the unemployment rate is lower than their estimates of its long-run sustainablerate, so I think we are in the vicinity of full employment.

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. You have mentioned thatthe Committee thinks there will be wage increases next year. I’m wondering if you could clarifyif that is coming in part or mostly from the changes to the tax plan. Is that what the expectationis, would drive the wage increases? And I was also wondering, I’ve heard from so many femaleeconomists in academia and at the Fed about what an inspiration you’ve been to them and howmelancholy they will be to see you go. I was wondering if you just had any final words to youngfemales and minorities who may be looking to enter economics or a banking profession and riseto your level.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. I’m sorry, remind me of the first part of your question. [Laughter]

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG. Wages.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Wages, yes.

[SECTION]

HEATHER LONG. Is the tax policy driving wage increase expectations?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think, generally, in a strong labor market where many firmsare having difficulty finding qualified workers, we would expect, just through normal demandand supply channels, to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time. And as the laborremains at a low level, but I would expect, in the context of an ongoing strong labor market, tosee some upward pressure. And I believe that’s the main thing that my colleagues arefactoring in.On your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Federal Reserve, mycolleagues and I are very focused on wanting to see and do what we can to foster greaterDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALparticipation of women and minorities in economics. We would love to, if we could, increaseour hiring ourselves of women and minorities, and we see that both women and minorities arestudying economics in disproportionately and disturbingly low numbers. Although the womenin STEM fields generally are about even with men—represent about 50 percent—in economics,women majors constitute something like 30 percent of undergraduate majors, and there isdisproportionate low enrollment of minorities.I will just say, from my own experience, I think economics is a terrific field. I’vethoroughly enjoyed my career in economics and think there are many different paths that peoplecan follow that lead to satisfying careers, and that there are very interesting and importantquestions that economics addresses. And it is a great field, and I would like to encourage greaterinvolvement and think that people will find that satisfying. And, just in terms of the kinds ofresearch that’s done in the field, I think also a greater diversity, more women and minorities,analysis that they bring and a range of thinking that bears on research. And all of that would be ahealthy development.

STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Every day, it seems, we look at the stockFederal Reserve about current market valuations, and do they now or should they, do you think,if we keep going on this trajectory—should that animate monetary policy? Finally, maybe as asign of what’s been going on with valuations, this cryptocurrency called bitcoin keeps going upevery day. What is the policy of the central bank of the United States of the introduction, use,and incredible rise in popularity of bitcoin?December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Okay. So let me start, Steve, with the stock market generally. Imean, of course the stock market has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recentmonths characterized the general level of asset valuations as “elevated.” What that reflects issimply the assessment that, looking at price/earnings ratios and comparable metrics for otherassets other than equities, we see ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges—and so that’sworth pointing out. But economists are not great at knowing what appropriate valuations are.We don’t have a terrific record, and the fact that those valuations are high doesn’t mean that theyare necessarily overvalued.We are in a—I’ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we’ve talked about thisrepeatedly—likely a low interest rate environment, lower than we’ve had in past decades. And ifthat turns out to be the case, that’s a factor that supports higher valuations. We’re enjoying solideconomic growth with low inflation, and the risks in the global economy look more balancedthan they have in many years. So I think what we need to and are trying to think through is, ifthere were an adjustment in asset valuations or the stock market, what impact would that have onthe economy, and would it provoke financial stability concerns? And I think when we look atother indicators of financial stability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there or possibly evenorange. We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing someworrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this issomething that the FOMC pays attention to, but if you ask me, is this a significant factor shapingmonetary policy now, well, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor.And then you asked about bitcoin, and there I would simply say that bitcoin at this timeplays a very small role in the payment system. It is not a stable source of—store of value, and it1Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive levels.December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALdoesn’t constitute legal tender. It is a highly speculative asset, and the Fed doesn’t really playany role—any regulatory role with respect to bitcoin other than assuring that bankingorganizations that we do supervise are attentive, that they’re appropriately managing anyinteractions they have with participants in that market and appropriately monitoring anti-moneylaundering Bank Secrecy Act, you know, responsibilities that they have.

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN. Has there been a directive, or, more importantly, has there been adirective about bitcoin to the banks and their dealings with bitcoin from the Federal Reserve?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. I don’t believe there’s been anything specific about that, just,generally, banks have Bank Secrecy Act anti-money-laundering responsibilities, and this appliesto bitcoin as it does in every other realm.

[SECTION]

DONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair Yellen, Donna Borak with CNN. To return back to theprospective tax bill questions, in your view at all, is the Republican tax bill an ill-timed fiscalstimulus, and are you concerned at all it will wind up squandering the tools both the Congressand the Fed have when it comes time to dealing with a recession?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, look, I will just say that it is up to the Administration andCongress to decide on appropriate fiscal policy, and our job is to maintain our focus onemployment and inflation. We continue to think, as you can see from the projections, that agradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants nowfactoring in their assessment of the impact of the tax—the tax policy.You know, it is projected that the tax cut package will lead to additions to the nationaldebt and boost, by the end of the horizon, the debt-to-GDP ratio. And I will say—and this isnothing new, this is something I’ve been saying for a long time—I am personally concernedabout the U.S. debt situation. It’s not that the debt-to-GDP ratio at the moment is extraordinarilyDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALor worrisomely high, but it’s also not very low. And it’s projected, as the population continuesto age and the baby boomers retire, that that ratio will continue to rise in an unsustainablefashion. So the addition to the debt, taking what is already a significant problem and making itworse, is—it is of concern to me, and I think it does suggest that in some future downturn,which, well, could occur just for whatever reason, the amount of fiscal space that would exist forfiscal policy to play an active role, it will be limited—may well be limited.

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. A couple of longer-termquestions. First of all, midway through the year you talked about the issue of whether inflationtargets might need to be raised. There’s obviously been a lot more debate in the Fed’s systemsince then about this. It may not be an imminent issue, but do you expect it to be something theFed should be discussing over the coming years as some sort of change to the inflation target?Second of all, the amount of stimulus tools that the Fed may have at its disposal when the nextdownturn strikes are fairly limited. One of the incoming governors, Marvin Goodfriend, hastalked about the merits of negative interest rates. I just wondered whether you see that as apotential—or at least in theory, for the Fed to consider should it run out of other options.Thanks.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So right now the FOMC is not discussing or considering its inflationtarget. We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over the next couple of years, and Iwould say—you said our stimulus tools are limited. I would want to emphasize that if there werea negative shock to the economy, we do have some scope to cut the fed funds rate, and there areother tools available, ones that we have used previously: forward guidance and asset purchases.So I think we’re not—I wouldn’t say that we’re out of ammunition, but certainly it’s beenrecognized—and I’ve emphasized myself that, in the longer run, we may be—and we’ll have toDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALsee how this works out, but we may be in low interest rate environments where it could proveuseful to have additional scope to conduct monetary policy. And, in that context, I thinkadditional research—the academic economists and others are thinking hard about what morecould be done, and I think these are matters that are certainly worthy of further study.

[SECTION]

SAM FLEMING. So you do believe that negative interest rates, at least in theory, arepossible in the U.S. at some point if it should be necessary—at least in theory.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, I mean, on that I would say we have—that’s not something thatwe have studied inside the Fed to any considerable extent and haven’t seriously thought aboutusing ourselves during this last downturn and recovery. We have watched what’s happened inother countries. I think that’s worthwhile. And I would say it’s an area that academics may haveinterest in in the future and is worthy of some study, but it hasn’t been part of the Fed’s agenda.

VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Yellen. Victoria Guida with Politico. I just wanted toask you quickly, on the regulatory side, in your testimony to Congress recently you spokepositively about the Senate bank regulatory reform bill, and I was wondering if there are—beyond that bill—if there are tweaks to Dodd-Frank that you think might still be beneficial. Andthen, somewhat related, Governor Powell recently said that there are currently no U.S. banks thatare too big to fail. And I was wondering, do you agree with that assessment?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I mean, you know, I think I’m not familiar with every detail ofthe bill, but I think the bill does address a wide range of issues that, you know, we’ve highlightedin the past as being ones where perhaps additional flexibility to tailor our supervisoryrequirements would be worthwhile. So I don’t have additional things on the congressional list.Sorry, and what—the other thing—

VICTORIA GUIDA. Are there any banks that are too big to fail right now?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, you know, we continue to work seriously on resolution and theresolution plans, the living wills, and the structure of systemic firms to ensure that it would bepossible to resolve a firm—under the bankruptcy code would be the top choice of methods, or,alternatively, under the Orderly Liquidation Authority. And I think it’s fair to say that, overtime, we have learned more ourselves and more clearly detailed our expectations for the firmsthat file living wills. And the firms themselves have made considerable progress in, you know,changing what they do, whether it’s adopting financial contracts that would facilitate a resolutionrather than a disorderly unwinding of contracts, making sure that they’re appropriately dealingwith shared services so that key services would be able to continue, governance arrangements,legal entity structures—the firms have all made progress in adapting to our expectations of whatwould enable a successful resolution. So I think it’s an ongoing process, and I believe we havemade substantial progress.

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. I’m struggling toreconcile the pieces of the economic outlook that you’ve described today. You’ve said that weare basically at full employment. You’ve said that you’re expecting a tax package to deliver asignificant stimulus, and that it will be on the demand side. You expect growth to be faster. Youexpect unemployment to be lower, and yet somehow inflation is going to remain at 2 percent forthe foreseeable future. Could you describe what has changed about your economic assessmentso that everything has changed except inflation?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, you know, the projections that we’re showing you today, manyfactors went into that, fiscal policy being one of a number of different factors. And, you know,December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALyou’re looking at 16 participants who have made adjustments to their economic outlook for awhole variety of reasons, including, in some cases, rethinking some of the fundamentals thatwent into their original forecast. So there have been modifications in different directions bydifferent participants. So I would caution you about the dangers of looking at the median andacting like that is one individual who has made a change to their forecast. That’s a leap that isn’tquite justified.But, look, generally, you see modestly faster growth over the next couple of years, whichis consistent and, I said, I think for most participants, reflects partly an impact from taxesstimulating consumer and investment spending. But it’s not a gigantic increase in growth thatsince—relative to September.You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inflation has also beenrunning low on a persistent basis, and the Committee does have a concern about inflation andwants to see it moving up. And, on balance, you see only modest changes, slight revisions to thepath for the fed funds rate. You might think, well, shouldn’t I see more? Well, okay, growth is alittle stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower—that would perhaps push in thedirection of slightly tighter monetary policy. But, again, counterbalancing that is that inflationhas run lower than we expect, and, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor

JUSTINE UNDERHILL. Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance. So William Dudley of theNew York Fed recently said that the Fed is exploring the idea of potentially having its owncryptocurrency or digital currency. What use do you see a cryptocurrency could have for theFed, and do you see the potential of a cryptocurrency that might be considered legal tender?December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I want to distinguish carefully between digital currency andcryptocurrency. This is—there is a discussion going on among central bankers about thepotential merits of adopting—a central bank itself adopting a digital currency. And there mighteven be a central banker or two around the globe that might go in that direction. But I reallywant to caution that this is not something the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at thisstage while we’re looking at research on this topic. There are, I think, to my mind, limitedbenefits from introducing it, a limited need for it, and some substantial concerns. And so I wouldreally doubt that the Federal Reserve would soon go in that direction. But it is something thatcentral banks are looking at to see if there could be benefits from doing it.

CRAIG TORRES. Chair Yellen, before I ask this question, thanks for your stewardshipof the economy, the benefits of which I’ve seen in some of the harder-hit parts of my ownfamily, so—

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES. Your tenure. We’ve seen six Federal Reserve presidents appointed.One was a woman and five are men, so I’d like to know how that comports with yourcommitment to gender diversity. And, second, I wonder if you think this process of appointingReserve Bank presidents needs to be more transparent and accountable. Recently, the RichmondFed board took 11 months, and they came up with a candidate who was another Fed boardmember. And so I’m wondering what you would say to critics who say that looks like cronyism,and if you think, you know, this could be simply a more open process. These are votes onnational monetary policy, after all.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I would agree with you that these are important appointments.Under the Federal Reserve Act, the nonbanking directors of the Reserve Banks haveDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALresponsibility for conducting a search, and the Board of Governors has to sign off on thecandidates. We’ve made very clear and we monitor ongoing searches very carefully to makesure that absolutely every effort is made to create a pool that is diverse, and that there be anational search, and that every attempt should be made to create a diverse pool. At the end of theday, we cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these searches will result in an increase indiversity. I mean, I’ve been very pleased to see that there’s been some success in that regard, butwe have signed off on the individuals who were appointed and have held the view that these areindividuals who were qualified to serve in these positions. So I would hope—I would hope tosee greater diversity. It has been a challenge to achieve that.

[SECTION]

CRAIG TORRES. Should the process be more open somehow?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I think the process has become more open, and in a number ofthe recent searches there has been outreach—public outreach, information on websites,acceptance of potential names and nominees, and those have gotten careful consideration. Therehas been—there have been meetings in some cases with community groups to try to enlarge thepool and get suggestions, and I think that’s appropriate, and I think it has moved in the directionyou’re suggesting.

NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. I’mwondering if you have any advice for incoming Chair Powell?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, my colleague—I’ve had the pleasure of working with him nowfor many years, and he is somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and sharesits values. And as I mentioned in my opening statement, he is committed to the mission of theFed; to its independence; and to its acting in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. He is somebodywho has participated in the FOMC now for many years. To the best of my knowledge, he hasDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALbeen part of the consensus. I don’t believe he’s ever dissented. I think there is strong consensusin the Committee for the gradual approach that we have been pursuing, and Governor Powell hasbeen part of that consensus, so I feel he’s very well positioned and very knowledgeable of all theins and outs of everything that the Fed does. In supervision, in the payment system—he’s playedan active role there—and in monetary policy, and I have confidence that he is very capable ofsteering the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN. Do you mean me, or—as long as everyone gets a turn. This is JohnHeltman with the American Banker. Sort of a related question to what Nancy was asking—therehave been some reservations among some Democratic senators recently during GovernorPowell’s confirmation hearing and during the markup of the reg relief bill about the approachtowards regulation that the new leadership appears to be adopting. Do you have any similarreservations about the new leadership’s ability to deregulate in an evenhanded way that keeps aneye towards the stability of the financial system and the—sort of, the advances that have comefrom post-crisis regulation?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I would say that all of my colleagues on the Board have expresseda strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have produced a stronger financialsystem. And I’m considering there stronger capital, particularly for the most systemicinstitutions—higher-quality capital, stronger liquidity requirements, a rigorous stress-testingprogram, and resolution planning that will make it more possible to resolve a firm thatencounters significant distress.So I have heard broad-based commitment to those things, and I think they are the core ofthe reforms we have put in place. I think all of us agree that it is appropriate to tailor regulatoryrequirements in all of those areas and others to the systemic footprint of firms. We have done aDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALlot to do that, and I think there is more that could be done, and in some areas it would requirelegislation in order to do that. But I believe all of my colleagues and I are in agreement on that,and we’re also focused on community banks and want to find ways to relieve burdens. So inthose important ways, I do think that all of my colleagues are in the same place with respect totheir priorities.

[SECTION]

JOHN HELTMAN. Are there any important differences between your colleagues andyour vision on regulatory reform?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So I have not seen anything emerge at this point that I would describeas a significant difference.

HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. So you mentioned inresponse to Steve’s question that asset valuations, you didn’t think, were on the sort of highpriority risk list right now. So I’m wondering, what do you think is on that risk list? And, morebroadly, what have you left undone? You’ve gotten high marks for bringing the economy backtowards its goals, but are there things that are going to nag you when you walk out of here ininterest rates. We’re not doing inflation framework. What’s at your top of—what’s at the top ofthe to-do list that you are not getting to see to bring to ground here?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So you asked about the risk list. There are always risks that affect theoutlook. We tend to focus in our own evaluation on economic risks, and we’ve characterizedthem as “balanced.” And I think they are balanced. You know, I can always give you a list of,you know, potential troubles, international developments that could result in downside economicrisk. But, look, at the moment the U.S. economy is performing well. The growth that we’reseeing, it’s not based on, for example, an unsustainable buildup of debt as we had in the run-upDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALto the financial crisis. The global economy is doing well. We’re in a synchronized expansion.This is the first time in many years that we’ve seen this. Inflation around the world is generallylow. So I think the risks are balanced, and there’s less to lose sleep about now than has been truefor quite some time, so I feel good about the economic out—the economic outlook.I feel, you know, good that the labor market is in a very much stronger place than it waseight years ago. We have created 17 million jobs. We’ve got a good, strong labor market and avery low unemployment rate, and I think that’s been tremendously important to the well-being ofAmerican households and workers. And I feel very pleased when I hear anecdotes from firmsthat tell me they’re having a hard time finding workers, and they talk about, given that they’retaking on people with skills that don’t quite match what they want, but they’re training them,and, you know, giving them the training that they need in order to be able to fill jobs. I thinkthat’s a development that is a natural one that occurs in a strong labor market that tends to buildhuman capital and worker skills, and that that’s a strong positive.As I mentioned, I think the financial system is on much sounder footing, and that we havedone a great deal to put in place greater capital, liquidity, and so forth that make it less crisisprone, and that has been an important objective.What’s on my “undone” list, you ask? We have a 2 percent symmetric inflationobjective, and, for a number of years now, inflation has been running under 2 percent. And Iconsider it an important priority to make sure that inflation doesn’t chronically undershoot our2 percent objective, and I want to see it move up to 2 percent. So most of my colleagues and I dobelieve that it’s being held down by transitory factors, but there’s work undone there, in thesense—we need to see it move up in line with our objective.December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINAL

GREG ROBB. Thank you. Chair Yellen, what do you think will be the drivers ofinflation over the next couple of years, and how long will the Committee go with lowunemployment, low inflation before you rethink monetary policy—this gradual rate hikes?Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, you know, I think for a number of years—so we’ve had anundershoot of inflation for a number of years. We absolutely recognize that. I think until thisyear, undershoot was understandable. First we had a good deal of slack in the labor market.Then we had plummeting oil prices. And, beginning in mid-2014, there was a markeddepreciation in the dollar.2 And those three factors held down inflation for a number of years.Now, in 2016, core inflation came very close to 2 percent. We seemed to be on a path ofinflation moving up, and this year, beginning in March, there seemed to be a sequence ofnegative surprises. Some reflect one-time factors that were easily identifiable, like a markedname, but we would judge—you know, inflation doesn’t always follow exactly. There are errorsand many factors that affect it beyond the key influences of labor market slack: exchange ratesand import prices and oil prices. Those are three big ones. But there are other factors that affectinflation too, and our judgment at this point is that transitory factors that are unrelated to thebroader macroeconomic outlook are holding inflation down.But I have tried to be straightforward in saying that this could end up being somethingthat is more ingrained and turns out to be permanent. It’s very important to watch it and, ifnecessary, rethink what’s determining inflation. A possibility is that the longer-run sustainable2Chair Yellen intended to say that, beginning in mid-2014, there was a marked appreciation of the dollar.December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALrate of unemployment is—it’s been coming down. Estimates in the Committee have come down.It’s conceivable that they need to come down even more.It’s not my judgment that inflation expectations have slipped, but that also remains apossibility that needs to be monitored. So there are—you know, there could be a rethink ofinflation. I think it’s important to watch inflation outcomes carefully and, if we don’t seeinflation moving in the manner that the Committee anticipates, to alter policy so that we doachieve our 2 percent objective. But, at the moment, most of my colleagues and I believe we areon track to achieve it.

JIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Chair Yellen. Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times.I’m wondering, you mentioned this is your last news conference. What are your plans when youstep down from the Fed? Are you going to remain in Washington? Will you go back toBerkeley? And, also, I’m curious if you have any disappointment that you’re not going to becontinuing in this job as some of your predecessors have done.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So, on my plans, I don’t have anything definite for you, I guess. Ihave a home in Berkeley and expect to maintain it. But I would say, my spouse is on thefaculty—he’s a professor at Georgetown and would like to stay in his job, and we expect tomaintain Washington as our base. But I don’t have any definite plans.Let’s see. And you asked me if I’m disappointed. So let me just say that I have served insenior positions in the Federal Reserve now for quite a long time. I became president in SanFrancisco in 2004, and I’ve participated in the FOMC since that time as president, as Vice Chair,and as Chair, and it’s been an immensely rewarding experience for me. I feel very positive aboutwhat we’ve been able to accomplish and feel tremendous, you know, loyalty to the institution.So I did make the judgment that this is the right time for me to leave, but I feel I have served inDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALsenior positions at the Fed for a long time, and it’s really been an honor and a privilege for me tohave had a chance to do so.

[SECTION]

ADAM SHAPIRO. Adam Shapiro with Fox Business. Glad to hear you’re staying onthe East Coast. I’m just curious, I wanted to follow up to the bitcoin questions, but—becauseyou’ve lived through what we all experienced in 2007, 2008, and—should the Fed take a moreactive role in trying to identify who some of the counterparty and what the exposure is withbitcoin as a potential threat to financial stability? Just—the best minds at the Fed can sometimesmiss these kinds of threats. Your predecessor, Mr. Bernanke, actually said in ’07 that thecontagion from subprime would not affect the housing market or the economy. So are weunderestimating the potential threat from bitcoin as it runs up in value?

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I certainly agree that it’s important for the Fed to attempt tounderstand emerging risks to financial stability and to be looking not just in the banking systembut outside it for developments that could pose financial risks, and we are doing that. And, Iwould say, one of the changes during my tenure is, we devoted—decided in the aftermath of thecrisis that we needed to devote considerable resources to financial stability to monitor foremerging threats, and now we have at the Board a full-blown division of financial stability that’sinvolved in doing that.Now, when you ask about bitcoin, I still see the financial stability risks from it as limited.Often, risks threatening financial stability arise when there’s exposure of the banking system tofluctuating asset valuations, and I really don’t see any significant exposure of our core financialinstitutions to threats from bitcoin if its value were to fluctuate. I don’t see a threat to our corefinancial institutions. So, undoubtedly, there are individuals who could lose a lot of money ifDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALbitcoin were to fall in price, but I really don’t see that as creating a full-blown financialstability risk.

MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I supposeI should be asking you a valedictory question since it’s the last question, but I don’t think youcan top what you’ve already said, so let me just do a couple of cleanup questions here. PresidentTrump, while you were speaking, just said that he thinks his tax plan will produce 4 percentgrowth. Do you think that is possible? Second, do you think that there is any Fed blame orcomplicity in the flattening of the yield curve, and are you worried that there might be some sortof policy mistake built into that that could slow the economy? And the last question, which is abit of a valedictory, is one that everybody on Wall Street has wanted to ask you for four years.Since this is your last press conference, can you tell us which dot is yours? [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. Well, I can answer the last question first. The answer is “no.” I’venever been willing to reveal which dot is mine, and I’m not going to change that now.So, you know, my assessment, and I think most participants’ assessments, as I said, of theimpact of the tax policy on growth has been informed by work by the Joint Committee onTaxation and other analysts. And everyone recognizes that there’s uncertainty about what theeconomic effects would be, and I wouldn’t want to rule anything out. It is challenging, however,to achieve growth of the levels that you mentioned. Look, if the package were to stimulategrowth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Reserve would welcome that. If it’sa supply-side—favorable supply-side developments that would be compatible with theattainment of our employment and inflation objectives, that’s something that would be very, verywelcome. But it would be challenging to achieve numbers like that.December 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALLet’s see, I think you also then asked me about the yield curve, and—I mean, there ismuch discussion about yield curve inversions and whether or not a flattening yield curve couldsignal a recession. Is that the brunt of your question?

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE. And whether the Fed has made—if there’s a policy mistakeembedded in that.

[SECTION]

CHAIR YELLEN. So this is something that we discussed and have looked at. The yieldcurve has flattened some as we have raised short rates. It mainly—the flattening yield curvemainly reflects higher short-term rates. The yield curve is not currently inverted, and I wouldsay that the current slope is well within its historical range.Now, there is a strong correlation historically between yield curve inversions andrecessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causation, and I think that there are goodreasons to think that the relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycletwo factors. One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the secondpiece of it is a so-called term premium that often reflects things like inflation—inflation risk.Typically, the term premium historically has been positive. So when the yield curve hasinverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well above average expected short ratesover the longer run. So with the positive term premium, that’s what it means. And typically thatmeans that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite restrictive, and some of thoserecessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tightening monetary policy becauseinflation was high and trying to slow the economy.Well, right now the term premium is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and thatmeans that, structurally—and this can be true going forward—that the yield curve is likely to beDecember 13, 2017Chair Yellen’s Press ConferenceFINALflatter than it’s been in the past. And so it could more easily invert. If the Fed were to evenmove to a slightly restrictive policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero term premium.So I think the fact the term premium is so low and the yield curve is generally flatter is animportant factor to consider. Now, I think it’s also important to realize that market participantsare not expressing heightened concern about the decline of the term premium, and, when askeddirectly about the odds of recession, they see it as low, and I would concur with that judgment.Thanks very much.
