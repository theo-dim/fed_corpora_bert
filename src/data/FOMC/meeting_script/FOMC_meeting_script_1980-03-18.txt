CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The meeting can come to order, gentlemenand lady. We have a lot of business to dispose of at the start and Iwill try to find my agenda, if you will excuse me a moment. We havethe election of officers. First of all, we have the election of theChairman--I keep getting reminded that this position is not statutory--and we need a nomination.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, after great soul-searching untillate last night, and contrary to the exhortations of many peoplearound this table, I have decided to nominate Paul Volcker as Chairmanof the FOMC!

MR. TIMLEN.I move that the nominations be closed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Without objection.We need a ViceChairman.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I nominate Anthony Solomon asVice Chairman of the FOMC.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Apart from the fact that we seem to have aplenitude of Davises--pardon me?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.And no Managers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The selection of the Managers comes in alater agenda item. If there are no objections to those officers, theywill be appointed. Now we need a Federal Reserve Bank to executetransactions for the System Open Market Account. That hastraditionally, as you know, been the New York Bank. Do we have amotion to that effect?

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.[Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. Scott, you mentioned the possibility that someparties may be suffering major losses by reason of the decline in theprice of gold. Would that include any major commercial banks?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. Well, not U.S. banks. A few of them haveoperations in gold, but they are mainly merchandisers of gold in thatthey buy from either the IMF or out of European markets, or in thepast from the U.S. Treasury.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.[What about]European banks?3/18/80

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. One or two European banks could be sitting onlosses. On the other hand, they are very well capitalized. I thinkthey can withstand such losses.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Scott, you said that the fundamentals-inflation expectations, the current account, and so forth--were not infavor of the dollar. Do you see continuing strong pressure for thedollar to go up in the face of that?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. No, one of the reasons we repaid our debt soquickly was that there is the risk of a snapback. As I say, the onlything that is supporting us at the moment is really the interest ratedifferential. Market expectations toward the dollar are still verybearish.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. The question I would like to raise more broadlyis, insofar as we do anything in the market at all, should we restrainWe share with the Bundesbank in thethe dollar more than we have?proceeds of their support operation. In any event, if there is astrong movement, one can't do very much. But if the dollar goes up,say, three pfennigs in one day, wouldn't it be better to absorb someof that?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. Well, the rise of the dollar has been almosttotally during the European hours, and the Bundesbank has beenin oneprepared tooperation or the other. By the time we come in, the market is prettylimp. We have been able to do small amounts. We haven't wanted to dotoo much for fear that the market psychology would turn against ussaying:"Aha, the United States is trying to drive the dollar downSo it's a very, very delicate question. On the other hand,again."the Bundesbank has had some of the same problems with the mark that wehad back last fall when the dollar was going down and we were havingtrouble stopping the slide, even though we were intervening in bigamounts.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. The market moves against the intervention iswhat you are saying. The dollar goes up in Frankfurt against theBundesbank intervention and doesn't go up in New York despite theabsence of intervention.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. We have been prepared to operate a little, but[the dollar] has been pretty steady in New York.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. For once I don't have to recommend any swaprenewals. But I do have a rather complicated transaction to describe,so that I can be authorized to complete it. When the dollar came intodemand in late February, early March, the Bundesbank supplemented itsspot sales of dollars with forward sales of dollars against marks fordelivery in early May. The choice of dates was related to the3/18/80domestic liquidity situation in Germany. Mark liquidity was expectedto be more ample in early May than in early March, so the forwardsales of the dollar would help mop up some of that excess liquidity.Since the Bundesbankequivalent of marks.The total waswas sharing half of the mark proceeds of its spot sales of dollarswith us at the time, and we had no idea how long the dollar wouldremain in demand, we asked them if they might also share the proceedsof the forward sales. It took them several days to come back with ananswer; and when they did, they set some conditions that requiredconsultations on our side within the Federal Reserve and with theIn the meantime the dollar continued to rise and the SystemTreasury.In view of thecontinued to make good progress in repaying swap debt.Treasury's need for marks to cover the Carter notes, we finallyagreed. In response, the Bundesbank raised no objection. But afterfurther review on their part, they insisted that the Federal Reserveas the central bank of the United States be the direct counterparty onthe forward contracts rather than the U.S. Treasury.Subject to your approval, the solution we have worked out isonethat the System would enter into two sets of forward contracts:with the Bundesbank to obtain the marks directly from it, so that asthe central bank of the United States we are sharing in thatoperation; and the other between the Federal Reserve and the Treasuryto pass the marks directly on to the Exchange Stabilization Fund.These transactions would be at the same rates, so there is neitherprofit nor loss to the System. The reason I am laying this out to youis that the BundesbankAs Manager, it isdifficult for me to argue that these transactions would beExceptions have tobe expressly authorized by the Committee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.No, if the situation arises, I will [undertake]a very complicated negotiation to avoid our getting stuck with them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this seems more technical to me thanreal.The original transaction was at a market rate and what we aredoing is back-dating in some sense--not literally back-dating, butit's no longer at the market rate. The Treasury wants the marks andwe are a conduit. I don't see any big problem in this myself.

MR. PARDEE.Yes, liquidity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They were doing a lot of intervention andthe effect was to drain liquidity. They didn't want to drain thatmuch liquidity at the time, so they did a forward. That's why theydid it, as I understand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think Mr. Pardee has described ourpresent posture. We would certainly buy some marks, to the extentthat the mark is at these levels and to the extent that it is strongin New York. But as he points out, it hasn't been terribly strong inNew York. The Bundesbank has agreed to share with us theirintervention, but we will pass it on to the Treasury at this pointsince we are out of debt and the Treasury is under water by whateverthe number is now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Essentially, we will pass along our shareof their intervention to the Treasury until the Treasury getsbalanced. If the dollar remains that strong and indeed we do anyintervention in New York, we will pass that on to the Treasury, too.

MR. PARDEE. Yes, everything. The problem will remain if theI think we are going to have todollar comes under selling pressure.give quite a bit of ground before we start operating very vigorouslyin defense of the dollar because the Bundesbank certainly won't helpus for a long ways down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is a great concern in Europegenerally about their currencies depreciating because of the internalinflationary repercussions, and everybody wants their currencies toappreciate at this point. I think it's only that our interest rateshave prevailed here at the moment. But the danger is that they willraise their interest rates, which is one consideration we had in mindin handling our discount rate the way we did--not to give them such aI am not sure we arestrong signal for raising their interest rates.going to avoid it anyway, but it was quite clear when I was over therelast week that they were not looking forward with any joy to anincrease in the U.S. discount rate.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. Peter, would you have been able to come closerto the total reserve path if we had contemporaneous accounting?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. I really don't think it would have matteredI have not regarded the laggeda great deal, President Morris.accounting as a significant impediment to achieving the [path], aslong as we are able to make the kinds of adjustments we make in thenonborrowed path to bring speedier adjustments to the growth of theaggregates. I don't think it matters a great deal.3/18/80

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. Isn't it true that the one-week bulge in themoney supply practically made it impossible for you to hit the totalreserve path in the last three weeks?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, even with contemporaneous accounting,we are going to get bulges at times; and if we didn't provide thereserves, [the reserve needs] would be met at the discount window.The banks would have to borrow, or would have to do something, to getthe reserves to meet their requirements.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. You do have to be prepared to change yournonborrowed path frequently, I take it, as these borrowings numberscome out in ways that are unexpected.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. But, Chuck, how do you know which way it'sgoing? If we are making an adjustment in the nonborrowed, borrowingsgo up. It's hard to see which one comes first here. If we lower thenonborrowed path, that almost dictates an increase in the borrowings.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, that certainly is true. But I think we doit by looking at total reserves, too--by seeing what's happening intotal reserves relative to our path. What I worry about is that therenonmember borrowers who will come in once this bill passes. So wecould have a surge in borrowing, which is not really a reservebalancing decision but just a portfolio balancing decision on the partof those institutions, that we would need to adjust for in ournonborrowed [path].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is no question that if new borrowerscome in for emergency reasons or because they are new, we will have tomake an adjustment to allow for that. But I think this elasticity inthe borrowing numbers is very bothersome whether we are oncontemporaneous or lagged accounting. The contemporaneous might help.When are we going to have our report, Mr. Axilrod?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, at any time. Following the previous FOMCdiscussion, we looked up all our old work on the various proposalsthat the Presidents put forward. And we'd be prepared to bring theissue of lagged reserve accounting plus some of those other issuesbefore the Board at any time. If the Board were going to consider it,I would suggest that it be done in such a way that if any change weremade, it could go into effect when the new [law] goes into effect-So, in thatthat is, six months from the time of [its enactment].time frame--within a couple of months or earlier--we would certainlybe prepared to bring something to the Committee.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Do you mean on the other measures in additionto the lagged reserve accounting that the Committee has alreadydiscussed or just--?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.What are they?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, lagged reserve accounting, staggeredreserve settlements, and a few other things.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.You are going to be prepared with all ofthis?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Well, we could be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's try to do that. I think it's amajor hazard to introduce something that is going to be as difficultas this for the banks to handle on top of all this other stuff that wehave been giving them.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. My only point was that if the Board and theCommittee wanted to do away with lagged reserve accounting, the timeto do away with it is when the whole new reserve system goes intoeffect, [when it is] applicable to other institutions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.I understand that consideration.Mr.Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.I think my question was probably answered, Mr.Chairman. As I understand this process, every day you have a totalreserve path target in mind, right?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.I would say that what we have in mind fromday to day is more of a nonborrowed objective. Although as Idescribed, in certain circumstances, such as when we get a bulge ofborrowing over the weekend that may have been caused by banksanticipating a discount rate action, it seems sensible to come inbelow, let's say, a nonborrowed interim objective.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. But the figure on borrowings is available to youon a [daily basis]?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.Oh, I get a tentative figure every day, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. If we don't provide the reserves innonborrowed form, they will have to get the reserves either throughborrowings or be deficient in their reserves.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.Is that a bad thing?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, it depends on what degree of pressurewe want to impose on them at that moment.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.Are we fearful that interest rates will[rise]?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. The Committee has set bounds on the fundsrate.If total reserves were the overriding objective, bar nothing,then we could drive interest rates up to just about any point, I wouldthink.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And even then we can't affect totalreserves.The banks are just going to borrow. What we can affect ishow much they borrow in any particular week.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. But we can affect the degree of pressure theyare under so that they will start making adjustments.

It looks as if perhaps Februarymight have been the month when it could have been used. The question,as you look back in a little post-mortem, Peter, is whether it wouldhave made any difference. Would it have helped the cause, so tospeak, in preventing total reserves from getting too big, if we haddone what we thought we would have to do on that October 6 game plan,which is to put the discount rate up?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, of course, the discount rate was movedin the middle of February along with the Desk taking measures toimpose greater reserve restraint. There was a certain amount ofpressure that emerged almost automatically out of the process just byour sticking to our nonborrowed path when the banks were demandingadditional reserves. That automatically imposed some increased needfor borrowing. And then a further downward adjustment was made in thenonborrowed path to increase the degree of pressure, and at about thesame time the discount rate was raised. So by forcing the banks toborrow--I think it was around $1.8 billion--at an even higher discountrate, we put still greater upward pressure [on rates].What we got,as I described, was a very substantial move in short-term rates of 3or 4 percentage points over a few weeks. And I think it got somebanks feeling that they were staring very hard at the possibility of acrunch and the prospect of just not being able to fund themselves. Soin that sense the program is working; it has [produced] very realrestraint for the banking system. I don't know that bigger moves orearlier moves in the discount rate would have done anything more thanwas being done [through our operations].I don't know that we shouldhave [done] more because I think we were imposing quite a bit ofrestraint.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. One other question, Mr. Chairman. I would liketo ask Steve something in this case, in conjunction with the Bluebookalternatives. Steve, would it be reasonable or even feasible for thestaff to attempt to estimate a level of the discount rate that wouldbe consistent with the money growth targets?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, I share much of what Mr. Sternlight says.If you want to estimate an interest rate that would produce theseresults--I was hoping this method would get away from that a little-it seems to me that, if anything, it would be more like the federalfunds rate. In essence, if you look over a long enough time period,it doesn't matter very much what part of the total reserves issupplied by nonborrowed reserves and what part is borrowed. Whatreally matters for determining the money supply is the amount ofreserves, the total base out there to support money in some multipliersense. And over a long enough period, it can't really matter whetherthat's through nonborrowed reserves or borrowed reserves. In the veryshort run because of this mix, with required reserves fixed, it doesmatter because it affects the behavior of the funds rate given thediscount rate. But if we put in a high discount rate, then for anygiven total reserves we would have less borrowed reserves and morenonborrowed. If our estimate of the discount rate is low, we'd havethe reverse situation. So, while we could do that, we would simply bechanging the mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves for anygiven level of total reserves that would support the money supply. Idon't think that would be very helpful to you; we would be glad to doit, of course. I think in February the alternatives before theCommittee were: making an adjustment in the funds rate fast by3/18/80-12-raising the discount rate; making it more moderately by graduallylowering the nonborrowed path; or making it even more moderately bykeeping the nonborrowed path and letting a gentle rise in borrowingtake place instead of a rapid rise. What was actually done was tohave a small rise in the discount rate and a reduction in thenonborrowed path, which was somewhere in between all thosealternatives.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Well, if I could, I'd just raise one more point.In asking my own staff to review what went on during that Februaryperiod, it seemed pretty clear to us that the staff here and in NewYork had done a fine job of guessing what the multiplier was going tobe, what the total reserves should be, and what the nonborrowed pathshould be. There was very fine work on that. Yet the net outcome wasthat total reserves got out of hand on the up side for a while. WhatI am trying to get to the bottom of, with the benefit of hindsight, ishow you and Peter now think that could be headed off in the future.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, our views are probably marginallydifferent. A difference is that I might allege that we could hit thetotal reserve path week to week. I don't think it's very important todo it, but we could without lagged reserve accounting. But we'd haveto have very large movements in the federal funds rate because we'dhave to force the banks, within the statement week, to adjust theirdeposits to the total reserves we'd put out there. We'd have to forcethem to do it. Without lagged reserve accounting that is possible.With lagged reserve accounting, that could also occur. If we allowenough pressure on the funds rate, they could make the adjustments indeposits but we just won't see it in total reserves until two weekslater. So within a very short-run period it would look as if we weremissing our total reserves; but actually we'd be getting adjustmentsin deposits that would be [evident] in required reserves two weekslater and we'd really not be off very badly. We would just be overpath for a while and then we'd be back on path. That's the essence ofwhat Mr. Sternlight is saying and I wouldn't quarrel with thatparticular statement. Indeed, the money supply is coming back ontarget now, or seemingly so, if March turns out as we are projectingit. There has been a rapid response to the rise in the funds ratethat has occurred, just as happened in October, which may be acoincidence or it may be that the lags [in response to changes in] thefunds rate are not six months [but are closer to] one day. It's hardto believe the latter but something like that has happened for twosuccessive periods. I am not sure whether I have answered thequestion, but I think I at least came close to it.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. May I ask Steve a question? The advocates ofcontemporaneous reserve accounting argue that there would be lessvolatility in the funds rate than under lagged accounting. Do yousubscribe to that?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Oh no, I think there would be quite a bit more,for one reason. The one [internal] reason is that Mr. Sternlightreally won't be "able"--and I put the word in quotes because I don'tmean that he's really managing the funds rate--to adapt his operationsas readily because in the current week he won't know requiredreserves. [Suppose] this week we're going to provide $100 in totalreserves. Given the fluctuations in deposits that occur from week toweek, we really won't know whether the required reserves in the week-13-3/18/80If theyrelative to the $100 in total reserves would be $20 or $90.turn out to be $20, Mr. Sternlight is going to find that as he puts innonborrowed reserves, there are going to be huge declines in borrowingand huge declines in the federal funds rate. And he's not going tohave any alternative but to chase those borrowings down and put inmore nonborrowed. Because of the volatility of deposits week to week,I think we'd be certain to get more fluctuations in the federal fundsrate. However, with the system we're now operating on, where he knowsrequired reserves and we make adjustments on an average path for afour-week period, we make those adjustments so that we [take intoaccount] the required reserve pattern that we know for certain overthe two weeks ahead. And we tend to make the borrowings the same ineach of those weeks.So we let nonborrowed reserves vary with thedeposits while tending to hold the borrowing stable in an average pathI know that sounds like gobbledygook, but itfor a four-week period.is what we do.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. I wonder if I may ask two questions? The firstone is to Steve. Steve, on contemporaneous reserve accounting, howmuch of a change in deposits would you need in order to sweat out $1of reserve deficiency?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Governor Wallich.I am not sure I get the gist of your question,

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.It depends on what the multiplier is.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. The multiplier on demand deposits at the momentis roughly 6. So if we took put in $1 of reserves, we ought to get $6more, roughly, in demand deposits. But that is not certain; if we putin reserves, they may end up in currency or anywhere else for thatmatter. But that's the multiplier on demand deposits; it's a lothigher on time deposits.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. The point I am trying to get at is:Isn't theadditional adjustment you get from contemporaneous reserve accountingrelatively small? You need a very large movement in deposits in orderto overcome a small deficiency or surplus of reserves.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Contemporaneous reserve accounting, as nearlyas I can tell, does only two things for you. First, it absolutely canremove interest rates in some sense from your consideration. If youbelieved that there was a multiplier that the staff could predict, youcould set total reserves; you'd have to chase borrowing up and downbut you could come closer to hitting that total reserve target in agiven week. Lord knows what interest rates you'd have, but you mighthave the money supply. So the interest rates would be forced toadjust to the reserves. We wouldn't be doing what we do now, which insome sense is to make adjustments in nonborrowed reserves todeliberately force more interest rate pressure on the system. Thesystem would evolve its own interest rate pressure either up or downSo contemporaneous would do that foras we put in the total reserves.you; it would remove some little element of prediction we still haveas to what interest rates we want to see in order to achieve the moneyThat element is left in lagged reservesupply [objectives].accounting. The other thing it does, of course, is to speed up the-14-3/18/80response by 2 weeks. The latter isn't all that important presumablybecause 2 weeks out of 52 weeks is not any big deal.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.And you can anticipate it anyway but--

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We will have to have an exhaustivediscussion of these questions when we put contemporaneous reserveaccounting squarely on the table, so perhaps we shouldn't waste toomuch time now. I don't think we are going to change [our procedures]at this meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. May I ask my other question? Peter, whatdetermines your decision to buy coupons? You mentioned that youbought nearly $1/2 billion.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, we were in the midst of a period ofsizable reserve provision and it was a judgment that we should divideup that purchase. We anticipated the need to provide for an outrightincrease in the portfolio of some $1-1/2 billion. It seemedappropriate to do the bulk of it in the bill area, but we had notbought any coupon issues for a few months and just in accord with thepast dispersion of our buying it seemed appropriate to do some portionof it in coupons.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Would you have done about the same had the bond

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. We want to keep in mind that we don't wantto buy at a time when issues are very scarce and we'd have a sharpimpact on prices. Certainly the fact that the coupons were availablewould make some marginal difference in our decisions.

MR. GUFFEY. I would like to ask what may be the samequestion John Balles asked but in a little different way. Had weraised the discount rate early in March, having in mind that throughthe period total reserves would be over [path] by about $700 millionplus, would you not [conclude] that we'd have come closer to the totalreserve path and that the adjustment would have been a bit quicker? Iguess the alternate question is: What would you have projected forinterest rates? Would they have been any higher absent theanticipation [of a discount rate move] that was going on?3/18/80-15-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. If you had taken a further upward discount rateaction from 13 percent, say, to 15 percent, I would have predicted afaster adjustment ofthe money supply only if that rise in thediscount rate also meant that you were going to permit the federalfunds rate to rise substantially. If you weren't going to permit thefederal funds rate to rise substantially, I would assume that thatupward adjustment in the discount rate would merely have meant thattotal reserves would be the same over time but with less borrowing andmore nonborrowed. But if you had permitted the funds rate to rise, Iwould assume banks would have tightened loan terms and maybe sold offsome assets, resulting in lower bank credit, lower money growth, lessrequired reserves and, therefore, less total reserves down the lineseveral weeks later.dispatch.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just say on these questions ondiscount rates--I didn't hear the last answer Mr. Axilrod gave--that Iam not sure it makes a great deal of difference whether we move thediscount rate or not, except for its signalling influence, which mighthave been considerable. That's because we could adjust theborrowings, presumably, to achieve the same result. The reason thediscount rate was not moved--let's be clear about it--is that we werewaiting for this program, and it seemed inappropriate to raise thediscount rate when the Administration was trying to negotiate thesepending changes. The judgment was either right or wrong; but it was ajudgment we made. It certainly would have been disruptive to thatprocess if the discount rate had been raised in the middle of it whenwe said we'd have a coordinated announcement. Mr. Kichline.

We get all sorts of complaints about the availability of farmcredit or small business credit or mortgage credit. It is very hardto judge, I think, [the degree] of total restraint we have and thekinds of problems, institutional and otherwise, that are arising.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In connection with that distinction--thewillingness or need of banks to borrow at the discount window--I thinkit is important that we all reiterate publicly or otherwise the factthat this change in the discount rate procedures does not imply anygreater willingness on our part to tolerate borrowing. I think yourdiscount officers ought to make that point to borrowing banks ratherexplicitly. We don't know how they will react. One can argue iteither way. But any tendency for them to think that the window isopen because the rate, at least the surcharge, is closer to the marketrate, should be discouraged or we will get a perverse reaction fromthis action. I think a little more than usual calling to borrowingbanks may be justified under the circumstances to point out to themrather directly that this is no invitation to borrow.Let me just say in connection with setting the stage herethat the Chase Manhattan Bank said it is raising its prime rate to 193/18/80-17-percent today. At the same time it is instituting a small businessbase rate which remains at 18-1/4 percent, effective immediately.They used some language [in their announcement] indicating that theythink this is consistent with the philosophy of [the measures]announced by the Federal Reserve. They said they have some special[concern] for small businesses and they're acting to ease the strainsthat small companies face in borrowing money. The special rateapplies to companies with assets of $1-1/2 million or below and bankloans of $1/2 million or below. With total bank loans of $1/2million, that implies that a company is borrowing one-third of itstotal assets. The bank said the small business rate would apply toseveral thousand of its smaller customers.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. May I ask Steve a couple of questions first?Steve, I'm a little confused about the relationship between M2 and theother aggregates [in the Bluebook alternatives].First of all let meask this question: Is the relationship between the new M2 and GNPpretty similar to the relationship between the old M2 and GNP thatpeople often looked at? I'll get that answer first.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. My memory is that we have ended up with asomewhat better relationship. I had better not answer; my memory is alittle off on that.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. For the second more important question, let'slook at alternative B. The implied rates of growth for February torates for December to June, but the growth rate for M2 has only beenlowered by 3/4 point from 7-3/4 to 7 percent. Now, given the newactions, with the likely impact on money market funds, are we to[understand] that you believe there will be strong growth in MMCs and2-1/2 year certificates? How do you get that strong-MR. AXILROD. It may turn out that we seriouslyunderestimated the growth that would occur in money market funds overthe first two months of the year. So there was a much biggerexpansion in M2 than the Committee, in effect, wanted at that time.We have assumed that growth in money market funds would drop from hereon to a rate just slightly above what it was late last year. However,that was without taking into account the latest 15 percent marginalreserve requirement on those funds. Taking that into account, wewould think that their growth would continue but at a much slower-18-3/18/80rate. Using a rule of thumb that Governor Partee introduced to thestaff many years ago--and it's been difficult to find a [better] one-I would say that something like 50 percent of that money would go intoM2 type deposits and another 50 percent would go into large CDs andTreasury bills that are not in M2 but are either in M3 or liquidassets. I don't think that's too bad a view because roughly 50percent of the liabilities of funds are due to institutions andanother 50 percent to individuals. So I would expect that, ifanything, the 7 percent M2 figure you are referring to may be a shadestronger than might develop in light of the program. But I wouldn'texpect the difference to be large. That's as far as we've been ableto go [in our analysis].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I understand these inter-relationshipscorrectly, the December-to-June figure you show has a monthly base,but if it were on a quarterly base the way the yearly target is, theimplied 4th quarter to 2nd quarter figure for M-1A in alternative B,for instance, would be 5-1/4 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN. Steve, could you say anything about yourfeeling of confidence in that?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.I was hoping not to. I consider this asreasonable an estimate as a group of human beings working togethermight come to. I didn't give you the specifics, but it assumesroughly a $1 billion increase in M1 in the week of the 19th, which isthe week we're in, another $2-1/2 billion in the week of the 26th, andthen very little increase thereafter. But that gives us a high Aprilfigure because from February to the end of March M1 will haveIincreased 12 percent, roughly, and that gets into the April figure.wouldn't doubt, given our GNP projections, that we're going to have asecond-quarter rate of growth close to what we've estimated here onaverage, something like 4-3/4 percent. Whether it's going to comewith a large April or a large May or a large June, or whether it willbe an even distribution among those months, I really can't be verycertain. It would be misleading to say that I feel extremely certainabout this; I don't. But I don't think it's unreasonable.It wouldbe what a reasonable set of people would come to at this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's fair to say, in the light ofhistory, that there is no feeling of certainty about any of thesenumbers.It's my understanding that a refund will feed

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.Is that right?directly into the money supply.-20-3/18/80

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, there will be checks received byconsumers. The uncertainty is what people will do with them. Willthey deposit them directly in their savings and time accounts--inwhich case it will go into M2--or will they put them in their demandaccounts? And if they put them in demand accounts, will they holdthem for one or two days? In that case it will have some effect onM1 but a very small one. That is the reasoning [underlying ourestimate].If people put the funds into demand accounts, we wouldn'texpect them to stay there long. Why would people want to hold moredemand deposits? So, they would either transfer the funds to anotherasset, such as a money market fund or a T-bill or something, or startspending them. In that case, any little upward effect would begincoming down in May and June and July. The only evidence we've reallyhad was on the tax rebate program where checks were sent out to peopleas a tax rebate; those very clearly had a discernable money supplyeffect. On these kinds of refunds, we don't have the experience thatwould enable us to be very certain about [the effect].So, we arewaiting for something to happen; we haven't seen it yet and we may notsee it this whole-MS. TEETERS. Well, suppose the refund is real and it occurs.Is that enough to knock us off of our money path growth?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, as we said last time and this time also,we think the effect in the three months of March, April, and May mightbe on the order of 1 to 3 percentage points [unintelligible] and thenunwinding to that extent in June and July and piddling out in August.That's our estimate of what might happen. But we haven't deliberatelyput that in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a big seasonal in April to takecare of this in a normal way?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Yes, but the refunds this year are estimated tobe about $12 billion above the average of the last two or three years.So it's more than normal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.What is the normal?

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. They are estimating about $46 billion, I think,so $33 billion or so must be normal.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I don't remember the exact number. I don'tknow whether Darwin [Beck] has it. Well, this year we're estimatingthe individual tax refunds to be somewhere on the order of $48billion. In 1979, total refunds were $36 billion. Reading back, inrecent years they were, in billions of dollars, 36, 34, 31, and 29.So you can see that it's a quantum jump this year on the order of $12billion. In March of the previous four years the refunds were around$9-1/2 to $10 billion; this year they will be around $13.7 billion,according to these estimates. So it's a jump of $4 billion in Marchand roughly $3 to $4 billion in April.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Well, respond more generally, too.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. We have recently done a survey of our countrybanks and they tell us they are as tight as a drum, and the farmerstell us [the banks] are as tight as a drum. Yet we have very few ofthe country banks trying to pass on those loans to the city banks,which are not tight as a drum. When we get behind that, [we findthat] they're passing them off like crazy to the PCAs and so on, butthey're reluctant to pass them off to their city correspondents simplybecause the price is so high. So it's not really a question ofavailability in the normal sense, but a question of theirunwillingness at least to this point to try to pass those higher rateson to their farm customers who are used to substantially lower rates.Now, I don't like the implication of that, in terms of the directionwe seem to be going, which is to give preference to small businesses.But I think that is the real issue in their mind. It's not that themoney is not there; it's just that they're unwilling, so far at least,to contract for the higher price.The only other comment I would make is that, like manyothers, I was disappointed in the movement in the President's programfor fiscal 1980.That puts a little extra burden on [monetary policy]for this year. Therefore, to the extent that we do err, I think we'regoing to have to err on the tighter side rather than the easier side.If the deficit inFor fiscal 1981, I favor the reverse of that.fiscal 1980 is around $35 to $40 billion and then in fact [the budget]really does get balanced in fiscal 1981, that's a $35 to $40 billion[swing] in one year. That strikes me as a little larger than we'venormally accommodated and unnecessarily runs the risk of aggravatingwhatever recession we're in.It's too bad [the effects] weren'tevened out a little, with a little more in '80 and a little less in'81.I think that has implications for us in terms of how hard wepress during the next few months.

MR. WILLES. Well, the country banks have loaned out abouteverything they have. But typically, now, given the current primerate, the loans are at below prime, and they're reluctant to passthose on to the city banks.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, our staff has about the sameeconomic forecast as the Board's staff. I have a gut feeling that ifthe forecast is wrong, the result is likely to be a deeper recession.I am thinking primarily in terms of the financial strains that thesystem will be under. I think we've all been amazed at thewillingness of consumers and businessmen to take on loans at extremelyhigh rates. And it seems to me the counterpart of this is that we maygo into a recession [with] an awful lot of strains that are likely tolead to a deeper recession. One sector in particular that is showinggreat strains even in a forward moving economy is the savings banks;the situation in New England is getting critical. I was a littleshocked yesterday to find out that they may be in a position to haveordinary access to the discount window within as little as two weeks.If that's the case, we have an awful lot of issues to resolve. As youknow, in the past we have not loaned to organizations that wereclearly insolvent. The fact is that all the savings banks in NewEngland probably are insolvent if their assets are valued at current

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.That's true of many banks, too.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. It's true of banks, too, but it's much more thecase with the savings banks, particularly in New England where theaverage yield on their portfolios is very much lower than on the WestCoast. That's because (a) we've been a slow growing region; and (b)New Englanders don't change their houses as frequently as people inCalifornia do. That has led to a very old and very low yieldingportfolio. So, not only do they have liquidity problems but they havevery serious earnings problems. Most of the savings banks in NewEngland will probably show a deficit in earnings this year. There areother complications. There is this new dual rate which was set up todeal with large commercial banks. I think that is perfectly fine, inlight of the fact that that's where the growth of credit has been mostpronounced. But some of the most seriously troubled savings banks inNew England have assets in excess of $500 million. And the questionis: Do we want to charge them the premium rate? Another problem isthat most of the savings banks in New England are not insured by theFDIC. We have a state fund which amounts to about $250 million. Whatdo we do when that fund is approaching its limits? We're going tohave an awful lot of issues in this whole area of lending to thriftinstitutions coming down on us very soon that will need to beaddressed.-23-3/18/80

MR. MORRIS. Well, I think our current posture is doing thejob. I would advocate the alternative B approach. I don't see wherethe situation now requires a tighter posture. We have to evaluatewhat needs to be done. And I think we're going to see, as the staffis forecasting, a major collapse in housing in the next few months.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, I haven't talked to [any businesscontacts] since Friday, except to that group of bankers who were hereyesterday. But I must say that through Thursday of last week,businessmen, and by that I mean mostly industrialists, were stilltelling us in New York that they have great confidence in 1980 being apretty good year--maybe not a record year but a pretty good year.It's true that the money market banks and the medium size and largeregional banks have all been approached for, and have granted, loancommitments. And I know a few of them are very uncomfortable aboutmeeting those commitments.In upstate New York some of the countrybanks have been expressing a great deal of concern about the effect ofthe current level of interest rates on local small businessmen. Ithink local small businessmen are not unlike the farmers in theMidwest. There are stories that automobile dealers are just closingtheir businesses because they can't finance their inventories; ratherthan go bankrupt, they retire. We have the impression thatinventories are generally modest, although for some small retailersthey are pretty minimal.I have the impression that in New York Cityretail sales are pretty good, but that may not be the case outside ofthe city. We've had some indications that in the first two months ofthe year there have been price increases, particularly by the largegrocery chains.Some people explain that as the reason for all thecoupons we're getting in our Sunday newspapers.In effect, it'sgiving back the anticipatory price increase.We also have in our area the same grave concerns that Frankhas in Massachusetts and New England generally. Our thrifts are invery bad shape.Three of the ten largest mutual savings banks in NewYork were in the red for 1979, and probably more will be in the redIt is disintermediation on the one side and terriblefor 1980.earnings on the other side.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal, what wisdom do you bring usfrom Atlanta in your first presence here? Welcome.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, sir.It's nice to be here at thisinteresting time. Shifting to another part of the country, Mr.-24-3/18/80Chairman, the Atlanta District shows a remarkable reversal inattitudes concerning the economic outlook, it seems to me. Just amonth ago our directors and businessmen generally were virtuallydiscounting any recession, even a mild one this year. But in amonth's time that sentiment has changed remarkably, as I say. Theynow almost uniformly see a recession developing and perhaps a deeperrecession developing later this year. That even comes from our SouthFlorida directors who had been reporting very, very bullish conditionsright through last Friday. These sentiments, of course, were voicedbefore the President's program and the Federal Reserve program. It'sinteresting to note that this change is attitudinal and not based onany real change in basic economic conditions. Conditions in theDistrict generally are about the same as they were, although, ofcourse, we have had some softness in real estate sales andconstruction activity and a slowing in retail sales. That has beenreflected, too, in a less rapid run-up in bank credit than in otherparts of the country. But the perception of the future is that we'rein for a very difficult time. Our business people and directors seeautomobile dealers, farmers, small business people, and thrifts beinghurt pretty badly and I think there is a real fear at this point of acredit crunch coming along. While I don't have any data, and my staffhasn't given me any data about small banks, I have an intuitivefeeling that some of the small banks in the District are probably inmuch the same condition as savings and loans, although perhaps not tothe same degree. My personal feeling, after hearing all of this frompeople around the District, is that the pessimism is perhaps a littleoverdone. Recession, in my judgment, would not be all that bad if weare going to get prices under control.In terms of policy, it seems to me that we've got to get themonetary aggregates under control. February was perhaps a one-monthaberration, but there was a run-up in the aggregates. That, togetherwith negative market reaction to the President's program, is reallygoing to fuel inflationary expectations. Indeed, as has been remarkedhere, with energy costs increasing in the short term we could have anincrease in inflation. That is bound to cause consumers to lackconfidence in what has been done by the Administration, and we couldhave an increase in inflationary expectations with the obviousresults. So my judgment, Mr. Chairman, which is a little differentfrom the staff's at the Atlanta Bank, is to err on the side of greaterrestraint. While alternative B seems to me a viable alternative,whereas I would not consider alternative A to be viable, my preferencewould be to go for something along the lines of alternative C todemonstrate in the near term to the markets that we're going tocontinue with this program of restraint.

MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are in general agreement withIf we were to shade it a little, we'dwhat the staff has [projected].shade it along the lines that Frank Morris described because of theunrest we see in financial markets, along with weaker housing and alsoprobably weakness in investment, all of which we think may be morethan the staff is estimating. I would add one other caveat and thatis the feeling on our part that the international situation may beweaker than is generally being assumed. So we would shade theforecast toward a little deeper decline than the staff has indicated.By the same token, we would expect perhaps a more rapid recovery. The3/18/80-25-staff is actually showing no growth in real GNP between the fourthquarter of '80 and the fourth quarter of '81, and we think [GNPgrowth] will probably be positive.On the policy side, it seems to me that the best thing wecould do is to continue the policy we've been following. I think yousaid it all, and very well, yesterday before those bankers when youstressed that the backbone of our policy still remains our efforts tocontrol the aggregates. Not everyone heard you yesterday; there maybe some general doubt that we'll do that and some expectation thatwe'll back away. So, one could make a case for going with alternativeC. But it seems to me that alternative B is strong enough tounderscore our determination. The rates of growth in the aggregatesfor the last part of that six-month period are substantially belowwhat we actually had in the first three months, or think we had in thefirst three months. They are below our targets, so "B" seems to us tobe the best of the alternatives.So far as the federal funds range is concerned, I wouldprefer to drop the top and also the bottom of that range. I think weare now to the point where we can do that. I would not want to raisethe lower end, a possible alternative suggested in the Bluebook, sinceI would like us to be in a position to let rates come down prettyfast, if they do tend to do that in the face of a controlled set ofgrowth rates in the aggregates. I am sure that the Committee is notgoing to agree to abandoning that range; against that background,11-1/2 to 18 percent looks about right to us.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Winn.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, the crosscurrents are so extremethat it's difficult to sort them out and get a fix, particularly withlast weekend's adjustments not being factored into many people'sthinking. Three or four things, I think, are interesting. One isthat we turned off commercial construction--that is, apartment houses,office buildings, and so forth--completely in October, and it turnedback on in an unbelievable fashion in January and early February.We've turned it off again, I think, really in the last couple ofweeks; there are just no deals being made. But the profits picturethat is coming through on the deals that have been made are so unrealthat it's almost unbelievable. With the acceleration of rents andwith [builders'] fixed costs not moving up, the flows back to profitsare very, very high. That's particularly true where tax reliefoccurred, in California and Texas and places like that. In spite ofincreased operating expenses the profits picture is almostunbelievable. So, if we get any stability in [interest rates], myguess is that those [activities] will explode on us again as buildingpicks up.The second thing I'd report is that the major chemicalcompanies are showing profits in the first months of the year, andI've seen figures for month-to-month developments. While these areworldwide operations and one can't sort it out [for individualcountries], it was interesting to me that the price increases fromNow, I don't know how the price increases were divided up worldwide,but these are pretty substantial price changes.

Our railroad people arereporting really quite good operating results, much better than theyhad projected. And this is across the line, [even] with the downwardpush occurring in their automobile business. Our banks are showing amixed picture. Many of them are pretty well loaned up and are notseeing too much demand because of rates in agriculture and some otherareas.On the other hand, they are not seeing any problem withrespect to delinquencies or slow pays or any of the normal [signs] onesees on that score. We had, of course, in the last couple of weeksthis tremendous drive to increase commitments. Their customers weretold that lines of credit wouldn't be honored and they had to convertthose into revolving notes. So there was a tremendous scramble tooffset the anticipated [government credit] control system by suchthings as price increases and wage increases and also by an explosion,really, in lines of credit. They were taking to their boards demandsfor loans that were 5 to 6 times their normally weekly increase.We really don't know what the outlook is because we don'tknow how people will adjust; it's a crude guess that we're making. Inview of your statement yesterday and other concerns, I am veryconcerned about the [potential] April bulge, which could be muchlarger than is shown here. And unless we react to that, our owncredibility is going to be questioned even though [we expect the bulgeto unwind].We can't say "Oh well, it's going to go down in May andI have a feeling that we have torespond to current developments.

I don't want to raise it just to raise it. Butunless we respond to the increase, which could be quite large in thisperiod, we're going to have a real credibility problem.I am impressed with those who watch the Desk. They will tellyou exactly what the intervention points were; they don't see anychange in terms of our intervention points which [they say areapparent] to the market. People, in spite of all the changes, arereading [our operations] as if we were operating under the oldguidelines. While their perceptions are wrong, they still areperceptions; and we're dealing with perceptions as people interpretwhat we're doing and how they will react.

There is continued strength in consumer spending; it's almosthard to believe. I believe much of that still reflects a "buy it nowbefore it gets more expensive" approach. Labor demand in defenserelated industries and high technology industries such as electronicsand aerospace is contributing to continued strength in employment inthe District. Loan demand remains strong at banks and, despite therecent flooding in California, agriculture all around the West seemsto be in pretty good shape. I think the difference between West ofthe Rockies and what Mark was reporting probably stems from thepredominance of large branch systems around the West. I know that inCalifornia our three largest banks are among the three largestagricultural lenders anywhere in the country. And, of course, a goodpart of that lending is to agri-business, but they take reasonablygood care of the smaller farmers as well--to the extent that we havesome of those around the West, and we do. Demand for lumber you'dthink would be falling out of bed because of housing, and yet exportsto the Pacific Basin area have made up a good part of that. So, inshort, while this may not be applicable to the national scene, ourdirectors just don't see any signs of recession in our part of thecountry nor do they believe one is ahead for the regional economy.With regard to the national scene, it's obviously a different picture.

MR. BALLES. True. Well, with regard to the Bluebookalternatives, I can't really add much to what has already been said.All things considered, I would agree with much of what Willis Winnmentioned: One more month like February and our credibility is goingto be in bad shape. We recently had the first of the ABA/FRBseminars, which originally was supposed to cover the subject ofregulation under that plan that you encouraged us to get into. Wehad, I thought, a very good meeting. We had a number of people fromthe Board as principal speakers, some of the division directors andalso Governor Wallich as a principal speaker on monetary policy. Wegot quite a bit of flak as I remember, Henry. There was quite a bitof skepticism expressed in that audience about whether we were goingto stick to our announced target of ongoing restraint because of whatthose February numbers were showing--and they were aware of them bythen--on the money supply. Another month like that would reallyundermine our credibility a great deal, so I share Willis' view aboutdoing something about the April bulge if we can. And I think weprobably should. In general, however, I would go along with the specsin alternative B.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The agriculturalsector has been reasonably well covered in the comments made by MarkWilles and Bob Mayo. Our banks supplying credit to the agriculturalsector are very tight with respect to loan/deposit ratios. Butcontrary to what Mark suggested, we have found that the country banksare facing up to their problem and raising their interest rates toagricultural borrowers. They have no outlet for the loans even atthese higher rates, however, because the correspondent banks are notprepared to pick them up, even at a discount, at the rates the creditis being extended. [Cattlemen] are withdrawing from filling thefeedlots again as they turn their present stock, which implies lessmeat in the future I suppose. Secondly, as we go into the plantingseason, a period of high agricultural [loan] demand, there is a bit ofa safety valve, if you will. There is still a lot of grain in thehands of the producers, which can be sold at the lower prices nowprevailing. That would suggest that there will be a considerable-29-3/18/80squeeze on farm profits in the period ahead. But I don't think therestraint program will have a great impact on the agricultural sectorimmediately. The grain embargo probably will have as great an impactWhat I am really trying to say is thatas the restraint program.there are tough times ahead in the agricultural sector.Turning to policy, Dave Eastburn captured my concern verywell. In the Bluebook we are looking at a 4-month period instead ofthe usual 2-month period or even a quarter. It seems to me thatcredibility of the Federal Reserve System may be the more importantaspect, at least of near-term policy. The potential bulge in April ispart of the problem. I'd hate to go back to the [procedures used]prior to October 6 and focus on interest rates. But I think it'sextremely important--for international and domestic reasons,inflationary anticipation, and other things--that we not permit [thefunds] rate to come down very far in the next month or two. As aI would be inclined to moveresult, "B" looks very reasonable to me.a little closer to "C" because of the potential for interest ratemovements if indeed the demand for money begins to ease somewhatbecause of the lower projection of growth. And as I understand it,the restraint program may depress that another half percent over theyear. How that will roll into the [next] two months, I don't know.So, "B" would be reasonable and I would be inclined to move a littletoward "C" if that were the sense of the Committee. I would also setthe federal funds range by raising the lower end and reestablishingthe 4 percent spread, thus coming out with a 14 to 18 percent rangewith the anticipation that interest rates would remain in the upperhalf of that range for at least the next 60 days.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Well, [Mr. Guffey and I] are both from Missouri,and my approach to [policy] will underscore the great diversity ofthinking that occurs in the great state of Missouri, Mr. Chairman.Very briefly, the general condition of the economy as we see it is afairly level one with the exception of the building and real estateareas and automobile sales and manufacturing, which are obviouslyquite weak. Just last week we had a group of savings and loan peoplein for lunch, and they reported very severe trouble, as your savingsbank people are experiencing, Frank. Our agricultural loan demandcontinues strong. Basically, we haven't sensed any significantweakening in the last few weeks.With regard to policy, I would favor alternative B. I wouldresist like the plague any narrowing of the fed funds range. Ifanything, I would favor a widening of it; I certainly wouldn't seekthat, but I would oppose a narrowing of it. With regard to thismatter of credibility, I wonder if it isn't incumbent upon all of usto go out of our way in the weeks and months ahead to explain what weare trying to do and have our staffs at their various speakingI think there is a[engagements] concentrate on explaining it, too.general lack of knowledge.

MR. MAYO. Mr. Chairman, I would only add on the agriculturalside that I think some of the trauma accompanying the announcement ofthe grain embargo has subsided. There is a much calmer approach tothe problem and a little more Federal government credibility than[earlier] in the farm community, although they are still somewhatskeptical. We are, of course, in a very poor position on autos andhousing throughout our District. But capital goods are still runningquite strong. This is typical of what one might call "this stage ofI feel more comfortable than I did last month with thethe cycle."Greenbook [forecast], yet I would not be surprised if we got down to aminus 5 percent quarter [for GNP] before this forthcoming recession isover. I think we are getting closer, much closer, to the peaks thatwe keep visualizing and postponing, and we could easily have a creditcrunch--though I don't know how best to define that--perhaps in thenext 4 to 6 weeks.Having said that, I would be happy enough with "B," but Iwould tilt also a little toward "C," agreeing with what Dave had tosay. On the federal funds range, though, I would just leave the[lower limit of] 11-1/2 percent. It has no real significance now andI wouldn't want to see us push that up at this point. It restrictsour image of flexibility when it gets published. Instead, I wouldjust go to the 20 percent on the up side and be done with it,recognizing that that would give us cover for an interim period,rather than have to go back frequently to jiggle it up another half orone percentage point. I don't see any objection to going to the 20percent, given the rate structure we have today.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Rice.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, generally I go along with thestaff forecast. It seems to me that the new anti-inflationary programwill have the effect of making the coming recession deeper than itmight have been and might even bring it on sooner. If I have anyskepticism at all [about the Greenbook forecast], it's in the area ofthe timing of the recession. The economy appears to be continuingstrong, or relatively so. If I read the Redbook correctly, most ofthe businessmen around the country report remarkable equanimity in theface of the economic situation; they just don't seem to be excessivelyconcerned about--or, in any case, feel confident that they can dealwith--whatever is down the road. It's pretty difficult to findevidence of weakness in the economy aside from housing and autos; onehas to look pretty hard. One has to look behind the industrialproduction figures to see that there would have been a decline inindustrial production had production of autos and parts not risen.Also one has to note that capacity utilization in the primaryprocessing industries and materials-producing industries has declined.And, of course, the average workweek has declined somewhat. These areabout the only signs I see of any emerging weakness.So, I feel that our posture at the present time is aboutright, with the appropriate tautness in financial markets. I don'tthink alternatives B and C leave us much to choose between. Actually,[for M1] the difference between them amounts to about $900 million atthe end of June, and that doesn't strike me as being very much moneyout of the total money supply. So, it doesn't really matter too much-31-3/18/80to me whether we choose alternative B or C. If we choose alternativeB, it appears that we will have a slightly larger volume of moneystarting in April and a less substantial rate of increase in the thirdand fourth quarters. On the other hand, if we choose alternative C,we will have a lower rate of increase in the second quarter and ahigher rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters. Given thecurrent situation, it would seem to me better on balance to leanharder in the second quarter and increase the restraint then; thatwill [show through] in the third quarter and allow for a slightlyhigher rate of increase in those quarters when we expect the recessionto hit. Alternative C would probably be more consistent with thatscenario than alternative B, but I have to repeat that really itdoesn't make a great deal of difference. On the funds rate, for now Iwould favor a ceiling of about 18 percent, but I am prepared to raisethe ceiling if market conditions [warrant].

MR. WALLICH. It's very difficult to tell what effects ourpolicies are having. These high interest rates may hit some borrowersvery hard but they don't seem to hit others at all, and the net effectone can't predict. I see that Charlie Schultz, after the President'sprogram was announced, predicted a 2-1/2 percent rise in GNP for 1981,so he doesn't seem to think that this has a very powerful impact. Iam particularly concerned about the inflation forecast. I view theforecasts of both our staff and the Administration as wildlyoptimistic. The very slight recession that we are anticipating isvery unlikely to make that kind of dent in the inflation rate. Ofcourse, we have a history of always underestimating the rate ofinflation.I am aware of the repercussions of a firm policy at savingsbanks, small commercial banks, and elsewhere. As these [problems]come toward us, we have to be prepared to meet them, and I think weshould meet them in a liberal way--stretch our powers as far as theycan reasonably be stretched. But we should not be obsessed by theconcern that the recession may last a little longer or even be alittle deeper. As I look back over our record, I am impressed that wenever stopped fighting recession. We moved imperceptibly fromfighting the last recession and its consequences into worrying aboutthe next recession. And that recession concern essentially hasdominated our thinking and has brought us now to 15 percent inflation.It's a situation with very poor options, but I lean toward the firmerThe market has not been impressedones. That is, I lean toward "C."by our policy package except abroad. The bond market hasn't respondedvery much. Short-term rates are actually down. I think there is areal danger that if we now give the impression that we are about torelax our general credit restraint behind a shield of selective creditcontrols, we will get the worst of both worlds. We'll get theselective controls not working--I have not been very enthusiasticabout them anyway--but we should do what we can not to disavow themcompletely. That is best done by not throwing any burden on them andby holding to a firm general control. I think it's important at thistime not to convey the impression that the regular discount rate,which wasn't changed, is the discount rate and that essentially wehave taken evasive action in trying to avoid raising the discountrate. We should so operate on nonborrowed reserves that there is a-32-3/18/80good amount of borrowing at the surcharge so that the rate acquiressome credibility.If weFinally, I share the concern about the April bulge.have taken 15 percent out through the seasonal adjustment, there mustbe a lot of money out there--in reality, people don't draw checks onseasonally adjusted checking accounts--and that may have its effect.So in addition to "C" generally, I would like to see a funds range of14 to 20 percent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that our posture[If it was]of restraint had begun to bite before this past weekend.biting before this past weekend, presumably it will bite a little morenow. I have to admit I've held such views on several earlieroccasions, so I don't know how much weight to put on my current view.We did hear reports last week, however, of several real estatedevelopers being cut off by large banks in our District. Our recentsurvey of the agricultural credit situation does not reveal thetightness that has been reported elsewhere in the country. And I dohave the impression that our farmers are among those who are carryingexcessive inventories at the present time, largely in the interest ofdeferring income tax liabilities.I don't know to what extent the Greenbook projections assumethat the capacity of people to adjust to an inflationary environmentIn my areais behind us or to what extent it might still be ahead us.SomeI see indications of a good deal of capacity to adjust further.of this, of course, flows from the firm linkage that seems to havedeveloped between that area and foreign sources of funds forinvestment. Just to indicate the extreme to which this seems to beI am told that at the present time builders in our majorgoing:centers who complete expensive houses which they don't sell promptlyto local purchasers sell them to foreign buyers who then furnish themand rent them out. And this is a means of investing funds atobviously very low rates of return currently for the purpose ofgetting into real estate, in this instance in fairly modest-sizepackages. There are a lot of small business firms being sold toforeigners as well, all the way from the family-size motel to thefamily-size manufacturing firm. That seems to be going on yet at aI note that the oil drillers have been in Washingtonrapid pace.recently; they have about as much reason for being here at the presenttime as the farmers had a year ago and two years ago. The number ofactive rigs is at a 23-year high; the increase during the past monthwas almost spectacular and the increase over the past year was alsovery strong.So, the signals are mixed. As I say, it seems that credit isbiting but activity is still very strong and the outlook is strong. Ithink there's also a good deal of capacity yet on the part ofindividuals to adjust the management of their financial situation tocontinued expectations of inflation. Possibly one indication of thisis the alacrity with which they are willing to give up accumulatedinterest on CDs for the purpose of turning them in and getting a newone which will carry a higher yield. This has resulted in actuallines of people at banks in some recent weeks when the new rateannounced was significantly higher than the rates on outstanding CDs.-33-3/18/80As to monetary policy, the "C" proposal seems preferabletoday, primarily for the reasons that Steve Axilrod outlined in hisoral remarks. Others have commented along that line. That's all Ihave to say.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of alternative "B."Even [with "B"] the rate of growth [for M-1A] in the period from Aprilto June would be dropping to almost half of what it was in the firsttwo months of the year; even compared with the first three months,it's very low. If we go to alternative "C," we're going to be cuttinggrowth relative to the first three months in half, and that implies tome a very stringent credit market. If people think they've hadstringency these [past several] months, it's only going to get worseif we go to the more stringent specifications. I will be very brief:I support alternative "B" as it now stands with the 11-1/2 to 18percent range on the federal funds rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't know what's going to happen to theeconomy. Perhaps I am associating with people who are in difficultsituations and have become very pessimistic, and it may be affectingme. So, I may be more pessimistic than I ought to be. I would pointout that the projection seems to me very, very sensitive to the savingrate. The projection shows no increase in the saving rate in thesecond quarter and, therefore, the second quarter continues to be nota bad quarter. If in fact the saving rate should increase in thesecond quarter, it would be a bad quarter for the economy. And thatcould happen. On the other hand, the projection has sizable increasesin the saving rate in the third and fourth quarters, and those are thequarters of major recessionary movement. Whether those increasesoccur or don't occur will affect the character of that pattern. So,we still have the uncertainty that has been with us for some time, andthat is: What is motivating people and how might [their behavior] bechanging?I do feel that everything that has happened in the last monthhas increased liquidity preference. The rise in rates, which was verysharp and very noticeable, and the cutting off of credit cards tocertain low income groups, even before the President's program, havebeen played up in a major way in the local press here in Washington.The feeling that one might need to rely on one's resources more and onother people's resources less in the period ahead leads to an increasein liquidity preference, which would tend to give us rather largermoney numbers, generally speaking, relative to GNP than was the casebefore. I also think that the relationship between M1, or narrow cashbalances, and the real economy is changing adversely. That is, ittakes more and more M1 in order to get a particular real income; or weget less and less real outcome for the same M1 we had before becauseof [higher] cash balances, to the extent that people are buying morewith cash and not using gasoline credit cards and so forth. Thecredit lines that have been extended, many of which may call forcompensating balances, and the fact that we are forecasting more andmore inflation, mean either that a given M1 is going to carry with ita higher interest rate or lower real activity, or both. And I thinkboth is probably the case.-34-3/18/80So it seems to me that it's just the wrong time to bedeparting from the notion of a rather normative, reasonable increasein the monetary aggregates. I would very much resist moving to alower aggregate path like alternative C. If we get the recession,Emmett, which I believe we will, I think we'll find that the demandfor money in the second half of the year will be low enough so thatour problem won't be so much the upper end of our range but keepinggrowth within the lower end of our range.That brings me to one more point, which is that I would hateto have somebody ask me what I was doing during the crash and have toremark that I was defending our credibility. The people who say let'skeep those interest rates up there, regardless of what happens, arereally walking into a major trap for the economy and for the FederalReserve. I very much want to disassociate myself from that. I wouldgo with alternative B. I would adjust that path and slice a littleoff April and put it into May. I think that has the same effect, ifthere is a bulge in April, as going with alternative C. I amsympathetic to the idea that we need more room in the funds rate rangebecause there is a very good chance of a big bulge, and the Managerought to be able to move if there is a bulge. If there is no bulge, Iwouldn't expect him to move. Therefore, I rather like the idea of a14 to 20 percent range on the funds rate which, with the rate now atabout 16-1/2 to 17 percent, means we have some room on both the upside and the down side.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. Could I just ask a question? Isn't it true, if westick to the 4-3/4 percent annual rate of growth under alternative B,that we are going to have to reduce the rate of growth later in theyear?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make a few observations thatFirst of all, it's clearoccurred to me in listening to all this.that the economy is fairly level, so any month we look at thesefigures we're going to find some things down and some things up. Whatthat means for the future isn't very clear. There's considerablestrength and resiliency over broad areas of the economy or it wouldn'tbe holding level or a bit on the up side in the face of a decline inhousing and a decline in autos and some other industries. What standsout to me is that we haven't any room to grow here, given the declinesin productivity and other pressures on the economy. And if we triedto stimulate growth very much, we really would have no chance ofdealing with the inflationary psychology; we'd in fact face a blow-offon the inflation side if we don't already have a blow-off.Secondly, in my opinion--and everybody can be his ownpsychologist--at this point we don't have many believers in the viewthat inflation is about to ease off or, indeed, that the economy isabout to fall out of bed. There is more nervousness than there usedto be and some people are beginning to question whether they shouldn'tIt was characterized for me in talking to somechange their views.farmers from Iowa the other day, and I think their attitudes areprobably similar to [those held by people in] other sectors of theeconomy. A couple of them sitting near me said that they had boughtsome land last year at prices they considered exorbitant but theybought it confidently with the thought that prices would be even moreexorbitant this year. And they are wondering whether they made a goodbuy. In fact, they're beginning to wonder whether they could sell itor should sell it, but they haven't seen any evidence of a decline inland prices up until now. They were getting worried but they hadn'tseen anything. I suspect that a lot of industrialists are thinkingthe same thing in their own way. The fiscal policy program--and Ithink it has been underestimated a bit in the public press for avariety of reasons, political and otherwise--I certainly don't thinkwas strong enough to change these attitudes in any significant way.It may be to the contrary in the feeling that if anything is going tobe done, it's going to be done through the credit policy side.So far as the outlook is concerned, it seems murky to me. Ihear all these fears of recession and I even share them. But if youask me analytically whether they are any more certain now than theywere a year ago when we began hearing the same things, I don't know.I am pretty well convinced that it's going to start some time and that3/18/80-36-there's a risk, when it starts, that it may be greater than anybody isprojecting. But I thought that a year ago, too. Just when it willreally start, who knows? I know we--all of us, I think--havemisjudged the timing again and again. I share the thoughts that somepeople have expressed, most recently Governor Schultz, that we betterget this over with in terms of minimizing the total pain over a periodof time. I am worried about those financial institutions, and theworst thing that can happen to them is [for us to] fail to do the joband get the interest rate turn fairly soon. But the way to get theinterest rate turned is not by hastening it prematurely. If we haveanother false start, we'll be in considerable trouble even though thatclearly runs the risk of overkill. That risk is greater in itsinverse logic than if it's not killed at all; we'll be faced with thesame dilemma later on.In that connection, in getting out of our dilemma as best wecan, I put considerable emphasis on one aspect of the voluntaryprogram, which is to get banks to begin saying "no" on some loans andnot to put all the pressure on raising the prime rate. If the loandemands come home to roost [and they take the latter approach], itwill exert pressures throughout the money market as they go out andtry to finance the loan increase. If we accomplish nothing else inthe next few weeks--and I think the time is very short--if we can getthat message to the banks and they can get the message to theircustomers, we have some chance of at least moderating the short-runinterest rate pressures. I don't think we have a chance ofdissipating them but we do of moderating them and getting some elementof rationing in the area of the market where it does not now exist,namely among the bigger business borrowers. I would urge you to movepromptly on that voluntary program and get the questionnaires out andto begin on occasion, or maybe more than on occasion, a consultativeprocess with the banks, particularly the biggest banks in your areavery promptly.We have the April problem that has been referred to, and allof these things incline me toward resolving doubts in the direction ofgreater tightness in the very short run rather than the opposite. Theworst thing we could do is to indicate some backing off at this pointwhen we have an announced anti-inflation program. We have politicalsupport and understanding for what we have been doing. People don'texpect it to be too easy. There is an understanding that a lot ofburden has been placed on credit policy, and there's a willingness tobe supportive for the moment in that connection. I would not give allthat much weight to the degree of support we're going to get if thisis dragged out indefinitely and we have to go through this processonce again.Where that leaves me in terms of "B" and "C"--I don't thinkanybody mentioned "A"--is that at this particular juncture I find thefocus a little long, frankly, for me to come to any great convictionI share much of Governor Rice's feelings aboutbetween "B" and "C."those alternatives. I do attach some significance to the fact that ifwe took "B" literally, while the numbers as presented on page 6 of theBluebook look low, [they imply] running above our annual targets inthe way we calculate those targets. If we were going to be at themidpoint of the annual target, it would require a considerable declinein the second half of the year from the 5-1/4 percent quarterly growth-37-3/18/80pattern implied by "B;" and even "C" is above the midpoint of theannual target for M-1A.

That doesn'texcite me terribly at this point. Other people may have differentshadings but whether we're looking at "B" or "C" or something inbetween in the four-month time perspective, I believe it catches thespirit of what a number of people are saying anyway, to say that inthe next month or so--certainly before we next meet--we should beleaning toward taking our chances on being certain to be near thoseI am not saying we cannumbers in that very short-run period.guarantee that we will be within those ranges at any expense ofinterest rates or anything else. But when we're making up the pathsand deciding what the level of borrowing should be or whatever, weought to be resolving doubts and making sure March is as low asprojected and April is no greater than projected or that both of themare lower than projected because that's where our principalvulnerability lies--in this two-month period. If April is anywherenear as strong as the New York figures suggest, we'll be above the "B"alternative. I feel quite certain that we at least ought to beleaning in the other direction, and reasonably hard, during these nextsix weeks or so. We don't want to give the market a false signal ifthe money supply comes in very low for a couple of weeks that we arerelaxing too quickly during this immediate time frame, when we've justannounced these new programs and there is the kind of feeling in thecountry that I think exists. There is plenty of time before June totake account of any shortfalls we might have in the money supply ifthat happy event should occur in the very immediate future. I don'tknow what the March data are going to show. If March came in underMr. Axilrod's projections and we were facing--in terms of our seat-ofthe-pants judgment or the pit of our stomach or whatever--the kind ofbulge that is projected for April, we ought to be delighted with a lowSo, I am suggesting that we lean in that direction.And whether we come out between "B" and "C" over a four-monthperspective concerns me less than [that we take] this posture I havesuggested before the next meeting. We could reconcile my longer-termconcerns by making it someplace between "B" and "C" but in the end Icould probably tolerate either. But I do feel rather strongly aboutnot giving any false signals in the very short run at the risk of anyoverkill that might be implied by that.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Would you consider taking a shorter period oftime--in other words, setting a target for March through May?-38-3/18/80

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I could, but it's probably going to take alot of arithmetic here. As I say, we're going to be meeting again ina month and we can fine-tune the quarter further then. So that reallyconcerns me less than an understanding about what our posture shouldbe in the next month and how we will reconcile all the doubts anderrors and fluctuations in figures that we're going to have duringthat time period. Whether it's expressed as aiming at "C" or beingextremely resistant to anything above "B" doesn't concern me so muchI would put moneybecause I don't think those differences are great.in the bank if that happy day arose at the end of March or early Apriland the bulge that is being projected did not appear in that extremeform.

But in the spirit of what I amsaying, if the Committee wanted to raise it--particularly the upperIend--such a decision would reflect the attitude I am talking about.don't know whether we'd have to use [the full range] or not, andthere's no implication that we'd go out and use it because it's there.I don't have any particular expectations that the rate would have to[reach that upper limit] or that [raising the limit] carries anyI do think that we shouldconnotation at all that we will aim at it.resolve the doubts on the borrowing number by putting it a littlehigher rather than a little lower. And in that connection, I am notquite sure where we are specifically. I have lost track of thisrecently. I know borrowings are running over $3 billion on an averagebasis, but you were talking about a $2-1/2 billion figure as-MR. AXILROD. We have suggested a borrowing assumption of$2-1/2 billion on "B" and about $2-3/4 billion under "C."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what the right number is, butassuming you judged those two correctly, I would be inclined to usethe higher number. I am talking about the very short run for thestaff's initial planning. Now, if the money supply came in lower, youwould reduce it.

I think we're in a perverse situation here. Ifthose commitments are ever drawn upon, the banks are going to bepanicky and they're going to be putting their rates way up to protectthemselves.So you can have something concrete to shoot at--and let mejust say again that the least of my concerns is precisely whether it's"B" or "C" over a full four-month period--and to capture slightly theFor M-1A,flavor of what I am saying, let me suggest the following:use 2-3/4 percent for the February-to-June number; put the funds rangeat 14 to 20 percent, say, which again is no goal to shoot at obviouslyin either direction, but I'm trying to pick up the flavor of what hasbeen said around the table; and aim at $2.7 or $2-3/4 billion orsomething like that in borrowings in the very short run. And for thisimmediate period, and I am talking about a few weeks here, let'sreconcile doubts in the path-building--which are plenty, given theperformance of borrowings recently--on the side of being happier aboutan undershoot of the present projections for March and April than anovershoot.

And if the moneysupply figures were coming in a little high relative to theprojections we now have, we might raise [the borrowing level] a bit.I guess that's the implication of what we're saying.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I was assuming, Mr. Chairman, that one of theimplications was that the Committee didn't want to be as accommodativein April as we had in [the Bluebook] and that for whatever path theCommittee decides we might lower both March and April and shift alittle of that into May and June.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I object strongly to raising thefloor on the funds range. I have a feeling that when we hit therecession we're going to hit it very suddenly and that we may verywell get into a credit crunch. It seems to me that it would be wiseto keep the wide band and as [much] flexibility as possible. It alsogoes with my long-range feeling that we do want to have a very widerange on the federal funds rate and let the market determine the ratesover time. We have broadened the federal funds range, and I thinkthat was a move in the right direction. I don't mind going to [aceiling of] 20 percent, but I don't particularly want to raise thefloor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I find it very difficult to conceive thatwe're going to get to the lower end of the range before the nextmeeting anyway. This is probably the least important number we putdown. And from that [perspective], it doesn't bother me.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. I agree with that, but the idea of keeping therange wide in case we do get into a crisis situation appeals to me.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. It does seem to me, though, Nancy, [given that]we have raised the discount rate since the last meeting, that toaccept that floor, which is slightly below the 12 percent discountOperationally, one has to figure that banksrate [unintelligible].would first pay off the borrowings before the [funds rate] went lower.So, logically, there is a basis for a one point increase.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. I still think the wider the range, the better,because we really don't know what we will be getting into in the nexttwo or three months. And the possibility of a credit crunch is outthere; it's not an impossibility at all.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.It's quite probable.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.That would press the upper end, not the lower.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.It depends on what happens afterwards, Henry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we're talking about the visuals ofwhat is announced a month from now and I can't convince myself thatthis is an absolutely crucial decision. One could argue that raising-41-3/18/80the funds range is consistent and reinforces the notion that we're notbacking off. On the other hand, if we don't change it, it can beinterpreted as an indefinite widening of the range.Well, we have a small mechanical problem. It is small in onesense; I don't know that it affects anything. The staff has writtenthe directive tentatively to include a growth range for the wholefirst half of the year, which makes it even less sensitive to whatI don't know whetherwe're talking about in the next month or two.that's a good way to word it or not. The only problem with wording itfor the second quarter--and we can all convert this into a secondquarter growth rate--is that we don't know exactly what the [firstquarter] base is at this point. The equivalent of what I suggested,which is 2-3/4 percent for 4 months, would be about 4-3/8 percent forthe first half. And that begins to look a little too fine. We couldsay 4-1/4 percent. The last published target we had was 4-1/2 percentfor the first quarter, which I take it we will exceed.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Make it 4-1/2 percent for the half-year then.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can put in 4-1/2 percent for the halfIt doesn't capture the flavor that Iyear, which is right on "B."thought [we might want to convey] of putting it a little below that.But in very round numbers, it's not very different. When we get downto the point of how to express it within a 1/4 of a point, it'sdifficult. The 4-1/2 percent certainly implies no change. It impliesa lower growth rate in the second quarter than in the first, givenIt's a little easier than I suggested,what we know at the moment.but I suppose we could take care of that by some language which saysthat at least for the moment--I am talking about the period to thenext meeting--we want to be sure not to exceed [that growth rate].

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I think in October or sometime the language-not the number--was something like "4-1/2 percent or a little less."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, maybe we can use that language.Ithink it captures what I am trying to say, maybe better than I saidit. Well, let me review the bidding here. Suppose we put thedirective the way it is written [in the Bluebook] and talk about theFor theentire half-year [target as] 4-1/2 percent or a little less.On thefunds rate range, we would move the upper end to 20 percent.lower end there's obviously a difference of opinion, which is going tobe resolved. And in terms of the projections given to us, we willlean to being within those projections for the March-April period insetting the nonborrowed path target, interpreted as $2-3/4 billion ofborrowings right now.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.That looks low to me.

MR. TIMLEN. They will be borrowing at the higher rate whenthe funds rate is at 18 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What I am trying to get is some flavor.We have to make a decision as to where to put [the initial borrowingassumption].I'd be perfectly happy to put it higher and resolve thedoubt that way in the first round. In any event [the staff] needs toknow what we're aiming for.I am saying that for the March-Aprilfigure together we'd be unhappy if [money growth] were not at thatrate and we'd rather tolerate a shortfall. Having said that, there'sno promise we're going to confine [money growth] to that rate.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.Then you can't really confine the borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't mean to confine it.All Iam looking for is some assumption to go on. If you want to forgetabout that, we'll solve it otherwise on the understanding that we'reaiming for 4-1/2 percent or a little less [M-1A growth] for the firsthalf of the year. Now that brings us basically to "B" or less.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.Do you want to define "little"?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Well, less than, say, minus 1/2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).We're not talking about minus tenths.Governor Partee, that's a reduction ad absurdum.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. No, but I don't think we want [money growth] tobomb in the next few months. And I can't accept more or less than-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, nobody's talking about more or lessbeing minus ten. We'll resolve these doubts on the side of lessrather than more. And if that gets translated into the March-Aprilnumber as projected, we'd be happy to come in lower than higher.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, just to be clear:At the momentwe're projecting 4.6 percent [as the average M-1A growth for March and-43-3/18/80of this discussion, I would propose that we tend to even it out [overThat is, we'd target on something likethe four-month period ahead].3 percent or a little higher in March-April which would mean May-Junewould be around 3 percent or thereabouts; the two periods would beroughly even. March would be low and April high, but pressed downrelative to what we show now, depending on what the data we gettomorrow look like.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I resist a little the precision that'simplied that we can make it 2 percent less than an uncertainprojection that-MR. AXILROD. Oh, no;on, not what we'd achieve.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.I was talking about what we'd targetWell, that's one way of putting it.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.If you did it that way, that would show realresistance to that April bulge, if it occurs.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Yes. We would be targeting on [a smaller]bulge. If it started coming in even as high as we have projected,we'd begin resisting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we should kid ourselves,either. If the New York projections turned out to be right and therewere enormous upward pressure [in April], I don't think we're sayingwe would raise the federal funds rate to 25 percent in order to get[money growth] down to the plus 6 percent [upper limit of our longterm range for M-1A].

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The directive will be expressed as 4-1/2percent for the first half of the year or "a little less," if you wantthat modifier in there.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN. Right.[The range shown in the directive]would be 11-1/2 to 20 percent, if that's what you mean.

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.more dignified?Don't you think "somewhat less" is a little

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER."Somewhat less."Operationally weunderstand that. And there would be some language in the discussionto reflect--though I'd hardly put it in these terms--that we want totake particular care not to exceed that rate in the period immediatelyahead. To remain within [the six-month target] is roughly the way tosay it, I guess, as the March-April average would work out.We won'tput the borrowing [assumption] in the directive, but you understandwhat the implications are for that.So, the precise specificationsare only the first two numbers, but there will be discussion [in thepolicy record] about the importance, during the period immediatelyahead, of resisting an increase in the money supply beyond this sixmonth target.

What I think is consistent with theCommittee's discussion--I want to be sure of this--is that rather thanthe 4-1/2 percent for March-April and about 1 percent for May-June[implied in the Bluebook], I should shift some of that growth into-45-3/18/80

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we can take care of that inthe discussion. I was just trying to avoid some wording that reliedupon an internal projection.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I understand. I just want to be sure that whatwe're planning to do is clear to the Committee.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.But how much lower in March and April?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, I think we'd have to wait until we lookat the numbers and Mr. Sternlight and I have a chance to chew it over.But one thought would be simply to make March-April 3 percent and MayJune 3 percent in round terms and even it out. We generally tend touse an even [pattern] if we can. It doesn't seem likely that growthin March and April will be even, but maybe for the two months itwouldn't be unreasonable to target it that way. Then if March turnednegative at minus 1 percent, say, April could be plus 7 percent. ThatOr if March turned out to be plus 2 percent,would be an example.then the April [path] would drop down to a plus 4 percent rate orIt may not be that even; it will depend on whatsomething like that.it looks like.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, in light of Mr. Pardee's commentthat the only thing that is keeping the dollar strong in foreignexchange markets is the level of interest rates in this country, Ihave some difficulties in not moving up the floor [on the funds raterange], as a few people have suggested, to 14 percent. A 14 to 20percent range at least is a 6 percentage point spread as compared withthe 4-point range we started with. That 14 to 20 percent would be mypreference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That seems to be the only element on whichthere may be some substantial disagreement. Do you want to vote onthe other parts and leave that open or vote on the whole thing? Let'sdo it the other way around and see how many Committee members want tomove to a 14 percent [lower limit] as proposed. That seems ratherreasonable to me. Let's look at two choices at this point: Move itto 14 percent or leave it where it is. Who wants to leave it where itis?
