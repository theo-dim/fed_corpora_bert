CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Are there any questions?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Scott, I was struck by your emphasis on thegood cooperation we have had. That certainly has been true in manyinstances. But wouldn't you say that the whole episode of the rise ofthe dollar several months back and the [subsequent] decline was aninstance of different rate intentions and different preferences for upor down on the part of the two central banks and that, therefore, wealways had operations in one market but not in the other?On the wayup, the Bundesbank held the dollar down in their market and we didlittle in our own. On the way down, we held the dollar up in ourI draw the lesson from this experience that we ought to move towardsomewhat more comprehensive coverage of the markets; each of thecentral banks should be potentially present in both markets at theI think that could probably be worked out.[same] time.[how]

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That doesn't solve the question ofwe reach agreement between the two central banks.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. What we would do, Tony, is to agree that thecentral bank that wants the bigger intervention prevails.If we arewilling to put money on the line to hold the dollar up, the Bundesbank[operates] in Europe. It has to be done for our account, but theywould do it. We would have to agree on a method of communicating withthem. And if the Bundesbank wants to have the bigger intervention,then they would prevail and we would do [the intervention] for them inNew York if necessary, or they could do it directly.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But that means we would have amechanistic formula whereby whichever side is more anxious to hold thecurrency up prevails.Even though there are departures from time totime between the Bundesbank's thinking and ours, if the dollar weretoo strong by their standards, during that period of time there wouldbe some divergence between us, which would have to be combated withtelephone calls and that sort of thing. But the more typicalcondition is one where the dollar is on the weaker side and, as wehave seen in the last few weeks, we get relatively good cooperationfrom the Bundesbank.I have the feeling that would continue to workbetter than to switch to the kind of approach you are outlining,Henry. I also am reluctant to have the main burden for supporting the5/20/80dollar put on the United States more than it has been. We have beenplaying our role and doing our share in the last year or two. It'snot benign neglect. But I think it is important that other keycentral banks also play a major role, and I am afraid that theimplication of your suggestion is that the United States would end upbeing the sole supporter of the dollar. I would rather live with thedifference of view between us and the Bundesbank during periods ofstrong dollar activity than start a whole chain of events movingwhereby we end up being the sole supporter of the dollar.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Well, I don't think that would be the result ofwhat I suggest. But perhaps we should examine this--we can't debateit here--and see if we can make some progress with it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. I have seriously considered putting in a doubleshift--that is, having people in the trading room at the Desk duringthe night hours when the European markets are open. We alreadymonitor the Far Eastern markets, but there have been occasions whenthere was a slippage between the time operations ended in the Far Eastand the Bundesbank picked up its operations in Europe. But for usthat's a major expenditure of personnel and other resources, and I'drather do that only if I felt it would be worthwhile for our people tostay up during those hours.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. By worthwhile do you mean in terms of likelyoperations or in terms of a special emergency that might happen?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. [I'm talking about monitoring] operations andwhatever feedback we might get from the European markets. We would bemonitoring their intervention as well as what is going on in the

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. I don't know how much that would cost but itseems like a good idea to me because what [happens now], as we see, isthat we sometimes wake up here and the dollar is down 1 percent andthe Bundesbank has done nothing. And by that time it is too late topush the dollar back up.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We can explore that more. There aresome disadvantages. It will become known that the Fed is stayingawake and is willing to intervene in the Far East markets. The keypoint is that it will be known that the Fed is willing to intervene inthe Far East markets and is doing 24-hour intervention. A 24-hourmonitoring may make sense, but I don't think we want to accustom theFar Eastern markets [to our] playing too big a role; that view wouldtend to be encouraged if they begin to see more and more Fedintervention in those markets. On the other hand, whenever we havethought instability was likely, Scott or Gretchen have put people onto monitor [developments]. And we have where necessary, and a bitreluctantly, [unintelligible] role in Singapore as compared to NewYork and to some degree Europe.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. There is no one more reluctant than I am.hour day is unthinkable.A 24-

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. I am a little surprised that you say there wasequal intervention going up and coming down. I got the impressionthat there was massive intervention by the Germans and the Swiss when5/20/80the dollar was rising and that they haven't done anything on the waydown--and we've done relatively little. Is that right or wrong?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.They've done more on the way down in recentweeks as a result of these mutual concerns. They're afraid that thedollar will start declining and [the monetary authorities will] haveto intervene and undercut their monetary policy, and they want tomaintain a certain policy restraint. And we have this other risk thatwe are running with a sharp decline in interest rates and that asudden decline in the dollar will trigger a speculative crisis againstthe dollar.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.But the amount of intervention since we startedout is nowhere near what it was on the way up.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.Yes, I agree with you. They sat very heavily onthe dollar when it was rising, and ferociously so. And they didn'thelp very much at first when the dollar began to decline. But again,in more recent weeks with this convergence of interests, they havebeen very helpful.We haven't had to intervene much, partly becauseof this atmosphere we are in. And I still feel that the environmentwe've had since October 6 has been conducive to effectiveness ofintervention because exchange traders are nervous; they are concernedthat if they take a short position in dollars, interest rates mightall of a sudden back up and it would become a very expensivespeculative bet for them. So, since October 6 we have not yet had todo the type of massive intervention in support of the dollar that wehad to do before, even with the environment we have had in the lastmonth.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Governor Teeters, it wasn't only the foreigncentral banks that were supporting their own currencies. We wereintervening substantially to find the marks to cover the Treasury'sintermediate-term debts. We may not even have done enough in thatregard. So we, too, were trying to take advantage of the improvingdollar availability to pick up the marks that would cover theTreasury's debts. We did it in substantial size.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. That is another aspect of this two-partysystem. We had different reserve objectives. We would have liked topick up some more D-marks. The Bundesbank was very unwilling to losedollars because they were running a current account deficit [and were]worried. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank sold a great many dollars andwe picked up as many marks as we would have liked. We could havearranged this the other way; had we done the D-mark support we wouldhave gotten the marks and the Bundesbank would not have spent thedollars.So we did this to some extent by sharing the interventionproceeds, but not fully.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Without] objection they are ratified.you have a recommendation, Mr. Pardee?Do

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. Yes. The Swedish Riksbank has asked if theFederal Reserve would increase its swap line by $200 million to $500million. You received last night two memoranda on the Swedishsituation--one by me and one by Mr. Caprio of the Board's staff. As Iindicated, the Swedish authorities expect a financing problem on theorder of $4 billion, which this year they plan to cover largelythrough official borrowings abroad. Of this, some $2-1/4 billion hasalready been arranged and additional loans are in the early stages ofdiscussion. In requesting an increase in the swap arrangement withthe Federal Reserve, Governor Wohlin of the Riksbank expressed concernthat the Riksbank needs more backstop in the form of short-term bridgefinancing than it currently has. The Riksbank uses an interventionapproach based on a currency basket and finances its intervention outof the proceeds of the official borrowing. In light of the currenteconomic and political uncertainties, the krona is vulnerable to asudden burst of selling pressure, and the Riksbank may be obliged to[obtain] dollars in the market at a faster pace than they are raisingthem through financing. In their view, the increase in the FederalReserve line would give them an added cushion in addition to theirdollar reserves and their other short-term facilities. GovernorWohlin has stressed that the Riksbank has no immediate need to draw onthe Federal Reserve, but he does not wish to rule out the possibilitythat they may come in for a drawing at some point.Now, as you can see from the memo, the Swedes are passingthrough a difficult time. But under Governor Wohlin the Riksbank hasacted to firm up short- and long-term interest rates and is pressingwith some success for a reduction in the fiscal deficit. The FederalReserve's agreement to increase the swap line could strengthen hishand in some of those negotiations at home. On the basis of thesevarious considerations, I recommend that the Committee agree to the$200 million increase. But given that we are living in a world inwhich we haven't had many changes in swap lines in recent years andhaven't had much experience with drawings on those lines, I would liketo introduce one wrinkle: That we make the increase for one year andthat we review the whole matter at the end of the year when weconsider the renewal of the whole [array of] swap lines and decidethen whether we want to put it on a permanent basis or not. So, Iwould recommend a 1-year increase from $300 million to $500 million,with a review at the end of the year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.What are your reactions?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I support the recommendation. Ispoke with the Swedish Governor when he called me and he emphasizedthat they would only be drawing [on the line] as bridge financing forperiods of up to about two months. And if we approve Scott'srecommendation, I think we should tell them not only that the increaseis only for one year but that each time they want to draw, they wouldhave to check with us and tell us what actions they intend to take andgive us a firm indication of the time period in which they intend to[repay the drawing], probably up to a maximum of about two months. Ithink there is a larger reason for going along with this, which isbasically that Sweden dropped out of the snake; it is not a member ofthe EMS. And to some extent their request to increase their swap with5/20/80the United States tends to symbolize something we haven't seen inrecent years, namely that the United States is the pivot and plays acritical role in the international monetary system. I think there isvirtually no cost for us. And not only would we be cooperating with aG-10 country, but in a subtle way [the swap line iincrease] would tendto underline the fact that the United States has a critical role. Iwould recommend it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are they making any arrangements with theBundesbank or anybody else?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.Well, I asked them that.They haveThey do not havethe ordinary kind of swap line with the Bundesbank. Scott, do youwant to explain what that arrangement with the Bundesbank is?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. Well, I'm not fully clear myself [but] theBundesbank does allow other central banks to accumulate marks up to acertain amount before they ask those banks to cash them. So, it ismore of a facility on the reserve currency side. The Swedes areborrowing marks quite frequently and they might want to keep some ofthem for a while. That's the arrangement.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. Do we have any other arrangements on our swaplines with a takeout arrangement similar to what you are suggesting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. For most of them, each time a centralbank wants to [draw on] a swap line we have some discussion as to whatthe conditions would be and what the period would be. Normally in thepast, though, swap drawings have been made for six months or a year.This would be somewhat unusual. Our conditions would be tighter inthat this is bridge financing and would probably not be for more thantwo months.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.I do think we should have that very firmly setEither we set down all thedown. It could be done in two ways:conditions when we take action now to raise the line; or we do what wesometimes have done in the past, which is to treat an existing line asa framework for discussion, not as a commitment on our part to lend.For example, Mexico has a line--what is it, $700 million? Italy has$3 billion and England has $3 billion. We take this as a frameworkfor discussion of both the terms and the amounts. I don't know whatThey many want to draw very soonlends itself better in this case.and it might make more sense to lay down all the conditions at thestart.But we shouldn't let it slide and then find that they areabout to draw without our having had the chance to make clear what theframe of reference is, as Tony specified. I very much agree with himthat we need a firm takeout; they have to say that they will go to theEuromarket [even] if conditions in that market are not very propitiouswhen the drawing matures.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. What are the risks of not applying conditions tothe swap line? Everybody seems to be in agreement. I don't knowwhat--.Isn't Sweden a good credit risk?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, Sweden is a good credit risk. Ithink the only risk, if you want to use that word, is that it becomes-6-5/20/80awkward later on with other countries if we do apply conditions andthey ask why we didn't apply them to Sweden. Our posture always hasbeen, even if the country is a good risk, that we want to be in aposition of applying reasonable conditions. Now, in the case of somecountries-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.So long as they don't apply them to us.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's an asymmetrical relationship.We don't exactly play the IMF role, but it is true that in the case ofsome countries that are less creditworthy--take Mexico--we would wantto know what their stabilization program was and what the policiesintended to get them out of trouble were going to look like before weIn the case ofwould let them make a [large] drawing on the swap.Sweden, we can't say that this should be bridge financing [until theycould get funds from] the IMF because they have only, I think, $4billion in external debt; it's not a country that one would push tothe Fund. We have to give them some direction. But there is somedanger, if we don't have some sense of the conditions, that we willhave more difficulty with other countries in applying conditions whenthey are really needed. I think that's the reason for having someunderstandings, rather than the risk of not being repaid.

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, remember, there is politicalimportance to their not being in the European Monetary System. TheGermans were furious when [Sweden] dropped out of the snake. That[furor] has died down and there's reasonable cooperation, but I thinkthey would look to the supplier of the currency in which they keeptheir reserves since they are not members of the EMS. Now, we couldalways make it a condition, but I would advise against it, that theyask for a similar swap line with the Bundesbank.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.How big is their swap line?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.It'smillion. On the point of when weimpose conditions, I would rather wait and see what the circumstancesare when they come in for a drawing. We can then review it with the[Foreign Currency] Subcommittee and put on the conditions that aremore or less specific to the circumstances at the time.That is why Ithink this review procedure and a 1-year limit on [the increase in theswap line] gives us a little more control.They are not in goodshape, but this all relates to 1980. We don't know what 1981 willbring. But I think our side will be better able to monitor it if wedo it this way.

MR. ALTMANN. Yes.It should be included in the SelectedList of Actions that would be available for inspection [this comingFriday].We don't need to make a public announcement as such.Itwould also be in the Policy Record, and any conditions attached to theincrease in the line would presumably appear in the Policy Record,which might be somewhat counterproductive from their point of view.Foreign Currency Operations require that there be advance approval bythe Subcommittee of any drawing up to a certain amount and by the fullCommittee beyond that amount.So [approval of a drawing] is notautomatic under our procedures.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this doesn't strike me as perfectionin terms of a precedent, but at the same time I see no strong reasonto turn it down. I do think we need an understanding now that theyI don't have any problems between 60 daysare going to pay it off.and 90 days or whatever and we can even exclude a renewal. But Ithink they ought to be told that this is a temporary increase; we arejust talking about a 1-year increase at the moment. We can have afurther discussion when they draw, but I think it has to be againstthe background of a clear understanding now.

MR. ROOS.Yes, Mr. Chairman. Peter, I'm a little confusedabout your April operations.You attempt to achieve our aggregategrowth targets, as I understand it, through the establishment andachievement of certain reserve paths--either for total reserves or thebase. Is that correct?-10-5/20/80

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. We are trying to achieve nonborrowed reservelevels that have been associated with the Committee's targets. Idon't think we are able to achieve, on a month-to-month basis, theCommittee's monetary growth targets.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Well, I noticed [in] the Bluebook that [thestaff], as I assumed the Committee as a whole would be, again wastrying to understand the reason for the rather substantial drop in theNow, during that month actualrate of money growth during [April].reserve growth was 2.7 percent for total reserves and 1.9 percent forthe monetary base.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.Right.Do you have specific figures

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Let me ask you this:in terms of the monetary base, for example, that you try to achieve asa guide for your operations?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. No, not in terms of the monetary base. Butwe do have specific figures for nonborrowed reserves that we aretrying to achieve--in this case for both the 4-week interval and weekby week. We have an objective that can be modified from one week tothe next because of technical factors. On one occasion we added someto the nonborrowed [path] because we were so far below on totalreserves going through this period.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. These figures--the 2.7 percent, say, on totalreserves and the nonborrowed part of that--I assume are significantlylower than the path that you sought. Is that a fair statement?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Total reserves are certainly lower. Thenonborrowed figure, as I mentioned, is coming out about on track.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Let me just ask this, pursuing this line ofquestioning: Isn't it possible for you to achieve or at least to getcloser to your path objectives than these two figures? It'smechanically possible to do, is it not?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, as I say, on nonborrowed we are comingout about on track for this period. For the total reserves, I thinkone can get a different view depending on what intervals one takes. Itend to think of this as the four-week block of time between Committeemeetings. And total reserves are coming out well below the path, bysome $850 million, on our estimate.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. What adjustments can you make, or do you make, ifyou see that we are coming out below the desired path, to supplyreserves so they come out to a higher level? I thought you almostautomatically try to adjust for that situation.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, part of the whole procedure that weare on now involves an almost automatic adjustment, because if totalreserves are coming in weak and money supply is coming in weak, aimingfor nonborrowed reserves means that there is going to be less demandfor borrowing.

MR. STERNLIGHT.In part what happens is that it is an almostautomatic response because as we aim for the path of nonborrowedreserves it calls for less borrowings, and conditions ease.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not entirely. Over a period of time thatthat's what the debate will be this morning, I presume. But the Deskprovided nonborrowed reserves more or less on path. It could havespeeded that up, and we would have run into our federal fundsconstraint, and we will run into it now. That doesn't mean that the[level of] reserves would have come up to the path right away.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. This is attributing to the money supply asignificance that I see hardly any economists attributing to it. Themoney supply is a means of getting [desired] interest rates. Peoplewho want a stable rate of money growth want wide fluctuations ininterest rates. So we can always decide how much interest ratefluctuation we want to have and go from there without subordinatingour decisions to the money supply. [If] we say that we don't wantinterest rates to move outside a certain range, then it seems to methat we've made the judgement that interest rates are to prevail up toa certain point.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, we've announced our targets to theCongress not in terms of interest rates but in terms of aggregates.We've never mentioned interest rates in our targets to Congress.

MR. RICE. There was a time when we used to think an increasein the money supply would cause interest rates to fall.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends.If the economy gets strongerand credit demands increase and the money supply rises, interest rateswould rise.If we're pushing up the money supply, then presumablythey would fall.

MR. GUFFEY. All of this discussion does point up theimportance of the discount rate, however. That's because we couldhave moderated the fall in the funds rate, the [final] standard, ifborrowings had been above zero. That is something we are going toface in the period ahead, and thus the Board [should] giveconsiderable [thought to] what to do with the discount rate. So longas borrowings remain at zero, we have nothing to operate against butthe funds rate--the fall of the funds rate itself--if we try toachieve these targets.

MR. KICHLINE. Yes, we have housing starts rising to a littleover 1 million units by the end of this year and continuing on up toabout 1-1/2 million units next year. Our forecast for the remainingmonths of the current quarter is for a bit further decline on average.But starts would average 900,000 for the current quarter and thenbegin drifting up next quarter so that they are at an annual rate ofover a million by the time we hit the end of the year. That'sessentially what we have built into our forecast currently. I mightnote that for mortgage rates to get to that level they would have to

And that'sone of the principal ingredients giving us for the second quarter avirtually unchanged saving rate even though consumption spending is

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I wonder if you would talk a little about yourprojections on the saving rate, Jim. What bothers me is that you havesuch a small rise in the saving rate over the next year when oneconsiders that it has been abnormally low and that we seem to seeevery evidence that people are trying to pay down debt and improvetheir financial position. And, of course, if that saving rate were tocome in significantly higher than you have projected, it would imply aconsiderably weaker economy.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. That's quite correct in terms of the forecastthat we have, in which the saving rate really never gets to 5 percentand then drifts lower. That is at least a percentage point below whatone might have expected on the basis of experience prior to the lasttwo or three years. There are a number of factors involved.Essentially, one is that we believe individuals will attempt to retaintheir standard of living. And when one looks at the composition ofprice changes, relative price changes have been extremely large fornecessities such as food, energy, and housing. So, our view is thatone of the elements driving the saving rate down recently has been thesurge in the relative prices of necessities; and individuals have beenwilling to let the savings side slip as an attempt to maintain theirstandard of living. We expect that to persist. We also tend tobelieve that the saving rate may have been adjusted lower as a resultof the inflationary experience [and will remain low] through thisforecast horizon, even though the rate of inflation is declining.It's still very high by historical standards, and there clearly hasbeen a change toward spending as opposed to saving. And I think itwill be hard to get consumers around to the view that they want tosave substantially larger portions of their income once they haveadjusted in this fashion. Admittedly, it is a very difficult part ofthe forecast. It often comes out as a residual. To go about this, weuse the saving rate as a check and then begin asking questions aboutit and whether we believe it's appropriate. If consumers' attitudeschange quite differently and in the aggregate they feel squeezed interms of their financial positions, as they ought to, then the savingrate might tend to be higher. And if it were, of course, other thingsunchanged, activity would be weaker.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Eastburn.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN. I tend to be at least as pessimistic as theprojections. There's one other factor that could enter in and Iwonder if you have explored it, Jim. And that is the [potential]catastrophic aspects of this, with large numbers of bankruptcies bothin the nonfinancial and financial side--in municipal finances and soon if they accumulate.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. That's one of the major risks in a forecastlike this because [the downturn] is deep enough and it also started-15-5/20/80with many sectors being in what we would perceive at least to be avulnerable position.[So], even though one is looking for that kindof evidence, those developments tend to be unpredictable and couldpose serious downside risks for the forecast. We have been lookingvery carefully, for example, at the corporate sector, and theThere hasaggregate numbers there do not provide any comfort at all.been a great increase in downgradings of corporations and cutbacks incapital expenditure plans, some of which seem to be stemming from thefinancial side. You mentioned also the government sector, and we areclearly getting a squeeze there with real expenditures declining; butwith the Administration's effort to curtail the rate of growth infederal expenditures, a good chunk of that [spending] falls on thestate and local sector.So there are sufficient concerns in thenonfinancial sectors as well as the financial sectors to be aware thatsomething may go wrong, and that could very easily set offexpectations in an adverse [direction].That is one of the risks thatwould argue for the possibility of seeing even lower numbers.Theywarning signs to be cautious.Individual bankruptcies are already up very

MR. MAYO. What about the $20 billion budget deficit that youhave for fiscal '81? Do I understand that that would be even largerif the import fee were cut out?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. Yes, that includes $10 billion, roughly, inreceipts. So if nothing else changed, the deficit would be in theneighborhood of $30 billion.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. So from your standpoint this is a swing from a $16billion or so surplus projected by the Administration?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. Well, some of the developments in Congresshave lowered that, though, so the numbers coming out of the Senateside were a small surplus. But the numbers are all on the plus side.I might note that we have not assumed passage of the withholding oninterest and dividends and that's worth something like $3-1/2 billion.We've assumed that some of the expenditure cuts won't materialize,given the much weaker economic forecast that we have. That's worth $4or $5 billion more in direct expenditures than we have assumed. Andthe remainder is accounted for principally by weaker receipts, higherunemployment insurance compensation, higher interest rates, and thatsort of thing. So, we've [made some assumptions] on the expenditureand tax sides, but the bulk of it is the different view of theeconomic outlook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I [am tempted] to suggest that you mightget into the more technical problems. But maybe we will defer thatand get whatever reactions we have at the moment to as far as you havegone. Governor Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, on this question of strategy for dealingwith a shortfall, I just don't know; I have a feeling of discomfortabout it. I suppose what it amounts to is that having suffered anunprecedented decline we ought to be prepared for an unprecedentedincrease to make it up, should it occur. Therefore, if we had asudden surge, restoring us closer to the trendline, that would be allright; that should be permitted without any difficulty. If we don'thave that, the question is: How hard should we push to get [moneygrowth] turned around? As a matter of procedure, I feel it'sincorrect in May to use the whole rest of the year to try to get backwithin the range because we may well continue to have adversity inreaching the numbers desired. And if we do, the shortfall will getworse and worse and harder and harder to adjust to. So, withoutspeaking to the policy issue, I just think that procedurally it isbetter to have a fairly moderate period in which we plan to recoup ourlosses rather than a long period. Therefore, [aiming to get] back topath by September strikes me as much sounder than [getting] back topath by December, which is the alternative given.As long as I have the floor, I might just go on. I thinkthere is a fair possibility that something big--really big--is goingon out there in the economy and that in fact we may not get a reboundin money supply or credit demand for some while. If that is so, thedestruction of income will result in a further weakening in finaldemand. And if that's the situation, that is a classic depressionsituation developing in the economy. The worst possible thing thatcould happen would be to continue to see credit and money contractbecause that would perpetuate and deepen the decline and really get usto the point that Dave was raising. Nobody ever projects what wouldhappen if we had a wave of bankruptcies because there is no way toproject it. We so seldom have a wave of bankruptcies that we justcan't see how bad things might be if that occurred. The last real bigwave was in the 1930s. And, of course, it created grave effects onexpectations and attitudes and the willingness to spend and so forth.So, if there is something big going on, it's terribly important thatwe stop the decline in money and credit. If there isn't somethingvery big going on, we will get a turnaround without doing an awfullot, in which case it won't turn out to be such a big problem. So itseems to me that the risks are all on the one side, and we ought tostructure our operations and our policy to recognize those risks.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. May I ask a question of Steve? Steve, what youhave done is [to present] two alternatives here, both of which aregeared to reaching the midpoint of the range. Now, Governor Parteefeels that structurally it is better to do it by September. Butdoesn't it leave us a lot of flexibility if we attempt at this pointto target the midpoint of the range by December? It gives us theflexibility, if we have a substantial shortfall, to look at the lowerend of the range as an alternative if money growth is not very rapidover that period.-17-5/20/80

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. That's precisely why I suggested September,because in fact we might continue to have a shortfall relative to ourexpectations, in which case having targeted on December we will haveno more room. I think we will be lucky if we are within the ranges atall this year. But it's just a question of how quickly we try to getback [within them].looks at.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. I'd like to make the opposite case, and in factexpress some concern about getting back on track even in December.There is at least a good chance that we have had a demand shift andthat we would just be pouring in money when [instead] we should havetaken account of the diminished demand for money. Nobody can say howlikely that is at this time. There are some indications--and I thinkit has a rather fair probability--so I'd give it weight.Certainlythe situation seems to be rather similar to what we had from the fallof '78 through the winter of '79. There was an unexplained shortfall,though not as drastically concentrated in one month; I think we hadclose to four or five months of negative M1 growth. Then, in thespring and summer the aggregates took off. For a while we said thatwas just compensating for the shortfall of the previous six months.Suddenly, in August-September we realized what was happening:Thatthe aggregates were running away, that it was not a compensatorymovement, and that we were going into an accelerated inflation. Andwe took the strong measures of October of last year; even that wasn'tenough and we had to do it again.So I think the pattern of having ashortfall and then trying to catch up--or allowing the aggregatesthemselves to catch up--has existed in the past. And it seems that itcan be very dangerous.Furthermore, under alternative B, M-lA would be growing at9.5 percent and under alternative A it would be growing at 7.6percent. Even if these very high rates of money growth didn't lead toan inflationary situation, which is not likely given that we probablyare going into a substantial recession, it nevertheless would be anuncomfortable situatuion to be moving at those rates of speed and thensuddenly either in October or January have to turn off the faucet andget back on track [to a path that] would be more consistent withmoderate growth. In other words, at that time, when the recessionwould probably be at its deepest, we would be confronted with turningoff the faucet and raising interest rates if we were to move as fastas these alternatives imply. I would not like to be confronted with5/20/80-18-that calamity. We can handle all of this, I think, within ourexisting target ranges, if we aim at the lower edge. I have a roughsense that we should aim [for growth in M-1A] by December at 1-1/4percentage points lower than the midpoint. We would be savingourselves about 2 percent growth or a little more. And taking downthe aggregates by that much, [as I've] proposed here, would not get usto very rapid rates of expansion. We would not incur the danger ofovershooting and would not run the risk of having to confront a suddenchange of pace that would raise interest rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Eastburn.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN. Well, I would like to shift the argument backto what Chuck started with. We really are dealing with probabilitieshere, and that's what makes it so very difficult. There is apossibility that we have had a fundamental shift in the demand formoney. There is a possibility that we are in for something bigger,perhaps bigger even than the staff has projected. It's very temptingto say: Let's avoid that kind of decision and just deal with theimmediate problem and face this issue later. I don't think we can[wait] because there's too much at risk. So we have to cast our loton [one side or the other].And I cast my lot on the side that saysthe probability is that we will have a persistent shortfall in moneygrowth. My reason for this is historical experience. A shortfall hastended to happen when we have had recessions and probably will happeneven more in a recession of serious magnitude, which is the kind Ibelieve we are going to have. I think we should anticipate that andget back to the [money growth] path as soon as we can; that to mewould require us to try to shoot for [a return to path by] Septemberrather than wait until December. I think Chuck is absolutely rightthat if the other [scenario] turns out to be the case and we findourselves with rather large increases in the money stock, we can pullback from that. But I believe the risk is more on the other side, andI would prefer to move more rapidly to get back to path.

MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I recognize the possibilities thatGovernor Wallich has outlined, and he outlined them very well. But Ifeel that if we don't [do something to] be on target before long, wemore than is desirable], at about the time the economy is recovering.And that's the time when we usually make our mistakes. So I come outabout where Governor Partee and Mr. Eastburn did, and I would alignmyself very closely with the remarks they made. I have some specific[recommendations to make] later on regarding the federal funds rateranges, the level and width of the ranges, and also the wording of theoperational paragraph.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Morris.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, one major problem I have with thefunds range of alternative A is that if we were to vote for a 10percent floor, after having given the Manager a 10-1/2 percent floorin our last telephone conference, I don't think we could honestly orwith a straight face say that we are trying to control bank reserves.Quite clearly, de facto, we would be moving back to controllinginterest rates. Now, if we are faced with a foreign exchange crisis,-19-5/20/80then we ought to be honest and say that we are going to keep thefederal funds rate where it is for the next month, hoping that thefundamentals of our balance of payments will improve and that,therefore, we are temporarily abandoning our policy to control therate of growth of bank reserves. As far as I can see, alternative Ais out for that reason unless we are willing to admit that we aregoing back to controlling interest rates, as we have done before,though the results of that [operating procedure] were not terriblysatisfactory. So I would like alternative B, but I would like a fundsrate range of 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, before we try to make a decisionon "B" or something else, I'd like to ask a question of the staff. Doyou, Steve, or any of your colleagues, have a judgment as to theextent to which the special credit restraint program of March 14-otherwise known in some sections of the country as "Jaws II"--might bea very inhibiting factor in getting back to path? We have scared offa lot of bankers around the country [by] having them appear beforeVice Chairman Schultz with their boards of directors and submit dailyreports and all sorts of other things. Unless we "unscare" thempretty quickly, I'm concerned that, while it's always hard to push onthe string, in this case it will be impossible. I've given you myview. I was really asking for yours.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I have a judgment; perhaps Jim also has one.Iwould say that it probably did have some effect on bankers' attitudes,or at least it seems so from the data. But perhaps even moreimportantly, it seems to have had some effect on consumers' attitudes.Spending has been very weak and I think that weakness is associatedwith a reluctance to use credit. There have been reports all over thepapers and it [is evident] even in one's personal experience thatpeople have some reluctance to use credit. Going along with thatthere has been some shift, apparently, to using cash and a shift topaying off debt and reducing spending. Whether the end of theseprograms would change those attitudes is an open question, of course,because once a person finally decides something is right, for whateverreason, I simply don't know whether the ending of a program is goingto change his mind substantially. That's particularly so if we're inthe middle of a recession when the program ends and people have somedoubts about future income prospects.But those are subjectivejudgments and we have precious little evidence other than to note thatthe sharp declines in bank credit and consumer debt are verycoincidentally related to the imposition of the program. Thatsuggests a change in attitudes, and I think it's the attitudes of boththe lenders and the borrowers.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. May I comment on that from an anecdotal pointof view on the basis of talking to bankers and others all over theI think Nancycountry who are involved in credit extensions?[Teeters] would corroborate what I say. Well, I don't know that forsure but I think so.It's clear that [the credit restraint program]was a real shock to the consumer. If the credit controls are removed,the people I talk to do not believe there will be a resurgence of thesame attitudes the consumer had before. They believe this effect isnot reversible. So I think it's important to get them off becausethey are having a serious effect on the economy at this point.I just5/20/80-20-worry about how we are going to get them off if we're going to have aneasy money policy, too.It could be pretty difficult to do both atthe same time, and I would hope that we would keep that in mind as weare talking here.

MS. TEETERS. Of course, Fred, if we take credit controls offand it has no impact--if people don't go back to spending--then we cando both simultaneously.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Let me comment further on what Fred was saying.The reports I've been getting are that credit sales have justplummeted. And it shows up on the profit reports of Penneys and Searsthat came out this morning. Another aspect that people seem to beworried about is that purchases of household durables were so strongin the second half of last year that [that sector] is not going torebound. Everybody has a new refrigerator. The other aspect of thisis that consumer debt is unbelievably high; and with a very low savingrate the chances of a rebound in consumer spending such as we've hadin previous recessions are much lower this time.I think that isalready built into the staff's forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.If I can end my comment, Mr. Chairman:Isuspect the March 14th programs--this is just an intuitive feeling onmy part--have done the job that we hoped they would do, and that wasessentially to break the back of inflationary psychology. Therefore,I think those programs have outlived their usefulness and they willsimply get in our way if we try to restore monetary growth, whether tothe lower end of the range or the middle of the range by September orquickly [the economy] can unwind from those programs. My instinctsare to go along with the alternative B target and to get thatrestoration done more quickly than by the end of the year. That'sabout the way I would come out. But I fear that the credit restraintprograms, unless visibly relaxed--I know you alluded to thatpossibility in public--are simply going to be one more inhibitingfactor getting in our way.

MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, I think this is a time when we needto go back and restudy some of our history on these things. Theproblems of our undershoots and overshoots are a little sobering itseems to me.It's a problem, really, of the gaps that occur in thisprocess. It's not just [a question of] when we get back on target,because the gaps are never corrected. I think our [undershoot]problem is something to be concerned about. I share some of Henry'sconcern as to what we do [later], but it seems to me that we have aneven more important problem as to what we do now. Consequently, I'm-21-5/20/80in favor of making an effort to get back on path by September. But Idoubt that even the funds range specified in alternative B is going toI think we have to have a wider funds range if we're goingdo that.to be serious about our efforts, and I'd be inclined to consider a 7to 14 percent range--not knowing what is happening on that score--as abasis of approaching our target by September rather than December.One reason is because the gap between now and December is going to bea painful thing for you to have to testify about in January orare loaded for bear. Others have studied the misses we have had inthe past, and it seems to me that we ought to learn a little fromhistory in our approach to the current problem.

MR. MAYO. First, on the credit restraint program:I, too,think it should be dismantled, but in parts. The time is already ripeI don't see any particularfor getting rid of the consumer part.damage in taking it off piece by piece if only because, based on someof our traditional observances, the bank credit hangs on afteractivity starts down. But also as a counterbalance, I feel we shouldkeep at least the special deposit on the money market mutual funds forperhaps a little longer than some others have suggested simply becauseof the public perception. If we take the special deposit off, peoplemight feel the Fed is out of its mind to do that if we really believedWe know the reasoning,in limiting their growth in the first [place].tying it to what the mutual funds invest in, but I think the publicperception would give us a black eye. And phasing out the equity[requirement] on the bank side too soon would give us a black eye.But I think a case can be made for dumping the consumer credit [part]pretty fast.Moving on to our policy question, I lean the way Willis does.We should be getting back on target or we will have a credibilityproblem again. I don't think [our recent adoption of] a 10-1/2percent lower limit has strained our credibility but [adopting] anylower limit higher than 8 percent would tend to strain the credibilityof our decisionmaking today when it comes out because, for better orfor worse, we have announced that we're going to concentrate mostly on[achieving] our targets for the aggregates.

MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I don't feel that I can dispelany of the uncertainty that has been cited here today. It is a veryuncertain situation. On the credit restraint program, I think itwould be desirable to announce that it seems to have achieved its5/20/80objective for the time being at least and, consequently, all requiredreporting under it will be discontinued with, say, the May reports.But [I'd say] the program itself is being put in cold storage forreactivation if and when it is needed. That latter part is simply onthe assumption that it would be politically expedient to say thatforthrightly [rather than imply] it at this point in time. But itdoes seem to me inappropriate to continue a fairly comprehensivereporting program in an environment where it's not doing anythingI think it will look rather foolish to the people whouseful for us.are reporting under the program and not-MR.

MS. TEETERS. Well, all the news has been consistently bad.Every day brings in another indication of greater depth of the slump.And it seems to me that the risks are all on the down side at thispoint.If we look at the staff forecast, they have made the recessiondeeper but somewhat shorter. And the total recession isn't muchgreater [before] some upturn. Probably it will be both deep and long,the worst of all possible combinations. As a result, I think weshould get back to our targets or we should be providing to theeconomy the sort of support that it needs at this particular point intime.So I would support alternative B, moving back by September, anda lower range on the funds rate.This does raise problems on theinternational side.If we move to where the interest rates aredropping to the 7-1/2 or 8 percent range, we may encounter some heavyIdrains [of funds to abroad] and heavy pressures on the dollar.think we have to face up to the fact that if we move to accommodateour domestic policies, it will have some international implications.It seems to me that we should openly face the fact that we're probablygoing to have to intervene rather heavily to keep the dollar where weSo thewant it to be in terms of international exchange rates.directive today should not only focus on domestic monetary policy buton how we are going to cope with the pressures, as they develop, inthe international market.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important tounderstand fully the nature of the decision we made on October 6 and5/20/80-23-the potential or lack of potential for accomplishing what we said wewere going to accomplish. As I understood the meaning of what we saidin October, it was that we were going to set fairly long-range targetsfor the growth of money. By law we have to do that. We haveannounced those targets to Congress and we've announced them publiclyas targets for a span of one year.[We said] that in any targeting ofmonetary growth there are inevitably going to be some overshoots andsome shortfalls. That is a part of the process. And if our objectiveis to achieve longer-range targets, when we have a significantshortfall such as we have [now] we will take steps to compensate forthat shortfall by expanding the rate of money growth in order to bringus back into the target range.I've always seen it as similar to theprocess of steering a large ship. If the ship swings off course, youattempt gradually to bring it back onto course. And in my opinion,these overshoots and shortfalls are not totally beyond our control.If they were, then we would be making better use of our time to beback in our various Districts trying to administer the variousprograms of a local nature. We do have the ability at least toinfluence the growth of money in a very significant manner. I thinknot only is the credibility of our October 6 program at stake, but thevery credibility of the Open Market Committee is at stake in terms ofwhether or not we perform what we've said we were going to accomplish.I wish there were an alternative C that could get us back tothe range even before September, but being a realist I guessalternative B is the best we can accomplish. But also being arealist, I would bet a Christmas turkey--although I'm not a bettingman--that there's no way of accomplishing alternative B and getting usback within the range by September with the constraint of a 9 to 14percent federal funds target.I see no reason why, after we'vefinally gotten into better habits than in the past by having a broaderfed funds range, we're all of a sudden [talking about] narrowing itagain. I think we should have a 5 to 15 percent fed funds range onalternative B, and I would certainly prefer alternative B toalternative A.Let me just close by making one further observation:As ourChairman has said repeatedly, as have others among us, accepting areduction in interest rates in times like this should not be construedas an easing of monetary policy. As for concern about the adverseeffect that a further reduction in interest rates would have on theinternational exchange markets, the day that any of us says thatpublicly, [people will say]:"Look, the Fed is retreating to its oldpractice of concentrating on the stabilization of interest rates."Ifthat is said or if that is perceived, I think we'll have a catastrophein terms of the value of the dollar on international exchange marketsthat will far overshadow the effects of seeing interest rates continueto drop gradually, if that is a necessary adjunct to achieving theobjectives that were stated in October.I feel very strongly thatit's a critical time [for us to persist] in what we're doing. I'vefelt a great deal of pride in taking to the hustings with the messagethat we are serious in what we're doing and we're going to stick withit.If we vacillate now, Mr. Chairman, I think the game will be over.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Schultz.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.I am amazed, and I must admit disturbed, at thefact that I haven't heard the word inflation mentioned around this-24-5/20/80table this morning. My word, it was only two months ago that we werewild about the subject and terribly concerned about it.I admit thatwe're in an unusual period. Things have moved exceptionally fast.But I don't think we can seriously say that we're out of the woods oninflation. And it seems to me that at least we ought to continue tothink about it a little. We do have evidence that things are gettingsomewhat better and are likely to get better in the future, but thatcertainly is not in the bag. And the perception out there isabsolutely crucial. There aren't very many people around the countrywho understand our change from a federal funds operating target to areserves operating target. But a lot of people understand that whatthe Fed does is crucial in the fight against inflation. And there arepeople who still do worry about inflation. If we move too rapidly,that could have some very serious attitudinal effects [on the]psychology of inflationary expectations and could subvert [anyprogress we've made in that area].The other side is that I think the economy is weakening veryrapidly and will turn down very sharply, and I want interest rates tocome down. But if they come down too fast, the result can becounterproductive. If we want mortgage rates to stop coming down [sorapidly] we have to let them back up a little. There is volatility.We gave up some things when we went to this reserves operating targetand one of those things was some stability in interest rates.Thevolatility in interest rates does have an impact on people. They seeinterest rates jumping up and down and they say:"What is happeningin the country?"Those interest rate risks get greater and lenderswant to protect themselves against them so they don't bring interestrates down as rapidly. We need to think about the rapidity with whichwe're [lowering the funds rate].I don't know if we [should] takethese lower targets of alternative A; I do believe we need lower fundsrates targets than we have in that alternative. But if we [implementthem], are we really going to [reduce] the interest rates that have animpact on people any more rapidly than we would if we proceeded alittle more slowly or had a little steadier approach? I think [aslower steadier approach] would avoid a lot of risks.So, I'dcertainly like to argue for alternative A, but I do admit that thefunds rate target would have to be widened some.

MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, we share the [view thatthere are substantial] uncertainties in the present situation but Imust confess that we don't share the pessimism about the economy thatI've heard around the table this morning. We certainly would not wantto minimize the extent of the downturn that has occurred. On theother hand, we don't view the recession as overly severe at thepresent time, nor do we think it's going to be as severe as it was in,say, 1973 and 1974. We have some things operating in our favor itseems to me. For example, inventories are in much better shape thenthey were. The construction sector of the economy is not as importantas it once was. There are other sectors that provide a cushion forus. We have a fairly prevalent underground economy, which seems to befunctioning pretty well. There are also some built-in structuralWe have the food stamp[elements] in the economy in our favor:program, the trade assistance program, supplemental benefits,Moreover, at the present timeunemployment compensation, and so on.interest rates are coming down, particularly on mortgages, which I-25-5/20/80think is going to foster a rebound in that sector of the economy andalso perhaps in the auto industry as we get lower rates there. Sothere are [developments] in the economy that are going to help us inthe long run, and my concern is with the long run and not the shortrun. We have had a couple of months with very low monetary aggregategrowth or a decline, but only a few months. And I don't think weought to be bullied into acting too quickly because inflationcertainly is still a problem.Now, if the credit restraint program comes off, that's goingto [provide] greater impetus to consumer expectations. And inflationI think we're going to get a rebound inis still going to be with us.the monetary aggregates in June and July. So for those reasons I hopethat the Committee will not overreact to the declines that haveoccurred and that we will take a more gradual approach to bringing thetargets back to their paths. Also, I don't interpret alternative A asa departure from our October 6 strategy. I think it does reflect thedesire to get back to our [monetary growth] paths but over a moreSo I feel that alternative A is the bettergradual period of time.approach. Whether the 10 to 14 percent federal funds target is theway to achieve that, I don't know. I think a number a little lowerthan 10 percent might be in order. But we do have the option oflooking at that between meetings, as we have done in the past, andthat might be a desirable way to go.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just to be accurate the phrase used in therelease was "more emphasis," not "somewhat more emphasis."

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay, I stand corrected but I thinkmy point is still a correct one. You did say that it was not amechanistic formula and that judgment would be used. Now, in a worldwhere there is so much uncertainty, I recognize that there is a goodpossibility that we will undershoot but there's also a goodpossibility that we will overshoot.I don't believe the FederalReserve System is so different from any person or institution in thepolicymaking arena that they should ignore the importance [of themaxim] that in a world where there is great uncertainty the prudentthing to do is to move gradually.Larry Roos said that our commitment was to gradual changes inthe money supply, although his recommendation was to use the fasterpath to get [back on track] by September. It seems to me that we needto consider the public's perception of us as central bankers, with aworld of great uncertainty on both sides. We need to maintain acertain public perception and level of confidence in what we are doingrather than make what others see as very major changes. We may thinkthat we are being consistent. But as Fred Schultz said, the outsideworld does not [understand] what we are doing in terms of this verysharp volatility. For us to move to supplying nonborrowed reserves-particularly since there's an assumption of virtually no borrowing ifalternative B is accepted--at roughly a 9 percent rate is completelyinconsistent with any responsibilities we have toward the long-runobjective on the money supply, which is our principal objective ascentral bankers. And, hopefully, there is a connection in terms ofthe rate of inflation. My understanding was that the Committee had asits long-run target a desire to edge down the money aggregate targetsas occasion permitted in order to achieve a long-run reduction in therate of inflation. I am concerned about our terms of reference in ourdiscussions here where everybody's position is completely predictable,including mine. And I frankly don't know how we break out of thissituation. But if there's no room for judgment--if it's going to beget back on path even [if reserves have to] increase at a rate of 9percent over the next few months, then it means with an assumption ofno borrowing that the Manager will be committed to achieving thenonborrowed reserve target. And he probably will achieve that. Thatwould not necessarily result in the aggregates behaving exactly inline, in proportion, but they will certainly go in that direction.How can we expect to maintainThe second point I want to make is:interest rates at lower than everybody's expectations regarding thelowest likely pace of inflation?There is nobody who assumes that therate of inflation is going to be below 10 percent even by the end ofthe year.

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, then I take it back. There isone person. Even Bill Miller said that he would hope to get it down-27-5/20/80to 10 percent by the end of the year. And we're talking aboutmaintaining short-term rates at lower than the rate of inflation.What is going to be the reaction of long rates, which have the biggestimpact on the real economy, if there's no confidence in the Fed as theguardian of monetary prudence and a strong anti-inflationary effort?We're going to get a perverse reaction. When we raised short-termrates as part of the November 1st package, there was a greaterconfidence that the Fed was coming to grips with the problem ofinflation, and long rates actually declined. If there is a widespreadperception that we are running a short-term interest rate policy withrates significantly below the rate of inflation, I think we're goingto have a perverse reaction in the long markets. And that will have aSo, I would hope that themore damaging effect on the real economy.Committee would opt for a more gradual approach in this area of greatuncertainty.

I also feel ratherstrongly--and the argument has already been made--about people'sperceptions if the federal funds rate is allowed to go much below theperceived rate of inflation for the remainder of the year. But itIf wepoints up again what I believe to be the operating reality:have no borrowings whatever, the bottom of the funds range that we settoday will be a constraint if at any time within the next week or twothe staff finds that the projections are not quite as strong as thoseput forth in the Bluebook. So, we'd really almost be choosing a lowerfederal funds constraint wherever we set that. I would opt to set itnot much below the 10 percent level. Thus, I would like to adoptalternative A--and maybe it will [get us] back to path by September-recognizing that if the staff is right we'll be within the rangeestablished for the year as a whole.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me see if I can sort this out abit. We've done a lot of talking about the risks in the situation,and they undoubtedly exist. The obvious risk is the presence ofrecession, and when that [occurs] one always has the feeling of beingin a bottomless period. Indeed, there is a certain degree of riskthat we are in a more bottomless period than we would expect or liketo be in. We have the risks of the exchange market situation. I willonly mention that; those risks are fairly obvious. I don't think wecan deal with them. I don't have any confidence that we can deal withthem through intervention anyway. I have nothing against intervention[in principle], but I have no confidence that we can sit here andescape responsibility or concern by saying that we can intervenebecause intervention is not going to take care of the situation fullyThat is not aif it really develops in an adverse way. I repeat:prejudice against intervention, particularly at the right point, whichis probably about now--before [the situation] deteriorates, or earlierrather than later in an effort to maintain a feeling of stability [inAnd we have the risk of inflation thatthe foreign exchange markets].Fred Schultz talked of eloquently. That's not a risk; it's here. Itaffects psychology. I think [the psychology] has improved somewhat,and it will affect how well we're going to do in coming out of thisrecession.I think we ought to recognize that we're in a situation thathas impossible aspects to it. There is nothing we can do here byfiddling around with either interest rates or the money supply, forinstance, to reduce consumer indebtedness, which is very high. Andthat is undoubtedly affecting consumer behavior at the moment, apartfrom all the [credit control] programs that we have. And there isnothing we can do about the fact that the saving rate is very low andthat there may be efforts to move it higher, and that's related to theindebtedness situation. I'm not even sure in some longer-rangeperspective that there's anything we should do about it because we'vebeen complaining about the saving rate being too low. The carindustry has problems of its own. They couldn't sell rear-wheel drivecars even when credit was available and people wanted to buy cars.All I'm saying is that we're not going to solve the world's problemsby what we do here. It doesn't mean our judgments are not important,but we're living in a difficult period with problems on all sides ofus. We have to evaluate how those various risks impinge upon eachother. When I look at all these risks, what impresses me is that thegreatest risk in the world is not whether we miss our targets or not.I don't want to miss our targets, but we have to put that inperspective of what is going on in the rest of the world. I don'tthink we can avoid some judgment about what we should do to minimizethose risks. We can't escape them. But I don't consider it a fullanswer to say we set down a target some time ago and we've got to hitthe midpoint of that target, as much as I would like to do that ingeneral.There has been a certain amount of discussion of the creditrestraint program. I think that program probably is having someI want to get out of it myself.effect; it's very hard to [quantify].I've spoken to that point publicly. It's a question of how to do itboth substantively and, in terms of our general posture, gracefully.I would expect some movement on that very shortly. I would make one-29-5/20/80I get comments sometimes from outsiders and fromother general point:insiders that if we take some action--let's say we remove all of thecredit restraint program tomorrow and we drive the interest rate downto 5 percent--and if we explain to the market that that's really atight money policy, then all the psychological implications will begone.I want to tell you that it just isn't possible.I'm not goingto cure in a speech what we do in substance. There are concerns aboutthe direction of policy and there's a lot of confusion. I'm notsaying speeches aren't important or statements aren't important. Butpeople who want to believe black aren't going to believe white when wemake a speech.A sense that we're giving up will contribute to higherinterest rates rather than lower interest rates in the long-term area.And what happens to the monetary aggregates may have something to dowith that, too.I'll just give you a case in point. I did make aspeech last week in which I said the money supply, I hoped, would goup. I had expected it to go up; I had in mind that we probably wouldbe pushing it up if nothing else happened. And interest ratespromptly went up.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.So did the money supply.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I knew the money supply was going togo up for a week when I made the speech. But I thought the reactionwe were going to get from that increase in the money supply was goingto be an increase in interest rates in the short run. That's partlywhy I said it.[I figured] we might as well get it in reaction to thespeech instead of in reaction to the number. All I'm saying is thatthe market is going to react in its own way to some extent regardlessof what we say, however important what we say is.Just don't be underany illusions that we can reverse attitudes by making a statement.When we look at the more specific decisions we have to make,I would just make a couple of comments that I think perhaps were notadequately reflected in the earlier comments. Presumably these rangesthat are set down and their accompanying federal funds rate rangesreflect our best professional judgment--I'm speaking in a corporate"we" now--as to what a consistent relationship is.I have expressedbefore my underlying skepticism about the accuracy of these kinds ofprojections.I have not lost my skepticism. All I say is that wedon't have much to go on in this area and this presumably is the bestjudgment that Mr. Axilrod and his cohorts have made about what levelof the federal funds rate is consistent with the targets that he'spresented.Secondly,--

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Having made the best judgment, that'sexactly right.I yield to nobody in my skepticism about these things.I am equally skeptical of anyone else's projections--maybe even moreso, if that's possible. The point has been made by several peoplethat the ranges are in fact ranges.Nobody has ever committed, at theextreme, to meeting the midpoint of a range. The thing thatpreoccupies me a little here--and I recognize that this is also thestaff's best professional judgment--is that the M2 and M3 figures arenot as bad, in the sense of a decline, as are the M1 figures. We'vebeen putting an awful lot of weight on M1 because we get it weekly andit's a more immediate operating variable. But we used to do an awfullot of talking about how important M2 and M3 were; and a lot of people5/20/80thought they were more significant [than Ml].I suspect, if we arerelaying suspicions, that if have growth in M1 of the magnitudeindicated in the Bluebook for either of the [alternatives], thatgrowth of M2 is going to be higher than growth of Ml.But they're[projected to be] practically the same. I suspect, particularly if itdoes turn out that interest rates are lower, that there could be quitean inflow into savings forms that would produce a somewhat higherfigure for M2 than for Ml. And we don't have to do all that muchbetter on M2 and M3 to be within our ranges.In fact, M3 is projectedto be within its range in May.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I should add, Mr. Chairman, that our long-runforecast, of course, is for interest rates not to be lower butactually to edge up.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.So, these may well be consistentunder that kind of projection of interest rates.But if interestrates in fact turned out to be lower, which is the gut instinct of anumber of people around the table and a gut instinct that I canunderstand, I think we're going to find that M2 and M3 are runningbetter than shown in the projection. We could clearly end up in asituation where M2 and M3 are pretty much, let's say, around themidpoints of their ranges and M1 is running quite soft.I don't knowhow one reconciles that even if our targeting allows for [differing]weights and all we look at is the targets. We have to balance thedesirability of meeting these targets against some sense of what theattitudes are toward what we're doing in the short run and over time.That has been amply discussed by various people already, and we havecome out with somewhat conflicting views about what that means forpolicy.I'm told that you have a revised first-quarter GNP figure,Mr. Kichline, which you might as well throw into the conversation.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. The revisions came out this morning. TheCommerce Department had previously indicated that real GNP rose 1.1percent in the first quarter; they now indicate the rise was 0.6percent. Final purchases are roughly the same at a 1-1/2 percent rateof increase. And now there is indicated to have been a smallliquidation of inventories in contrast to a small accumulation. Iwould only note that the composition has changed a fair amount, but ingeneral final purchases are where we thought and inventories are a bitlower.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure that that really changesanything. Maybe it's good that inventories are a little lower.I dothink, in making a specific decision, that we have a technical problemin the sense that we are in unknown territory when we are dealing withthe possibility at least that we're not going to have any borrowings,which is about where we are at the moment. In one sense, I supposethat could be an advantage. If we don't have any borrowing, we knowthat the nonborrowed reserves are going to be the reserves. And if weput out the reserves, presumably the money supply should follow-overlooking a few multiplier difficulties and all the rest--in time.But it also creates the problem that we may have a vacuum in theAnd the question arises as to whether we really want a vacuum between10 percent and zero.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.More than one may not have specified.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I think zero is a bit of a possibility, unlesswe constrain the funds rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The point of this is that there is a goodchance that at least in some weeks--for more than an isolated week assome of you [have suggested]--the lower end of the federal funds rangewill become a constraining influence on the speed with whichnonborrowed reserves are provided. That depends in part, of course,on precisely where the path is set in the short run, and these tableson page 7 aren't very enlightening in that respect because the-MR. MAYO.I suppose also we could cut the discount rate, Mr.Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You know, I'm not even sure how relevantthat becomes in these circumstances. We just don't know. I don'tknow whether or not $1 billion of excess reserves and a 13 percentdiscount rate will give us a federal funds rate of 7 percent insteadof zero. We really are in an area of unknown relationships at theI would judge that nobody is going to be very concerned if M1moment.or any of the Ms increased quite rapidly in the short run. I'mthinking of the situation where we have a higher increase in the moneysupply than currently projected over the next few weeks and it mightbe incorporated in a path that ran through September or December,whatever point we picked. If we began in the short run to run abovethat path and we mechanically applied [our procedures], we would drivethe federal funds rate up in the short run. As I interpret thediscussion, [we would not want our decision] to lead to that kind ofconclusion. That is, if we can pick up some money supply in the shortrun without raising interest rates, nobody is going to be very sadI'm not sure that's going to happen, but if it does, Iabout that.I don't know what thatdon't think people want [to see rates rising].says about the top end of the funds range.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I'm not saying put it in regardless.I'm just saying if it happens to arise now. I don't think that'sgoing to happen and perhaps we don't have to look at that extreme.But in essence what I'm saying is that we would permit some of that$850 million to be made up without any concern.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. I would interpret that operationally, Mr.Chairman, as meaning that if it so happens that required reserves inthe first two or three weeks of this forthcoming period come insignificantly higher than these paths call for, that we should adjustthe nonborrowed path up, given that [earlier] shortfall, in order toavert a rise in the funds rate immediately.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A rise in the funds rate of realsignificance anyway. I'm talking about it going up to 13 or 14percent or probably even 12 percent. That's a-MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, are we as a Committee accepting theconclusion that we really see great dangers in freely rising andfreely falling interest rates? When interest rates went way up, didthat cause disorderly markets?

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Did it really? Didn't the markets adjust to it?I hate to see the stock market go down or up. But why is thatdifferent than the interest rate markets?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not sure I have to argue thatpoint at great length. What I'm saying, approaching it from adifferent direction, is that we don't have to resist some recoveryfrom the shortfall in the aggregates that we've already had.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. With all the concerns I have, I wouldn't wantto see interest rates jump up now. I think people, at least peopleabroad, would think that we've really gone haywire.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'd have a different situation if we werewithin the target range or high in the range and the funds rate jumpedup. That's not the situation I'm talking about. Then we might wellsay okay, interest rates have to rise. But we've had a big shortfall.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Do you feel in your contact with the public, Paul,that nobody out there knows that we are no longer trying to control orstabilize interest rates? Hasn't that message reached anyone overseasor here or anywhere?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it has reached quite a few people.But we have a skeptical audience out there. Some people would say, if"Oh,they saw the money supply going up and interest rates went up:They will pick whatever variable theyyour policy has gotten easier."want to pick at the moment to attack us if they're skeptical to startwith. I don't think we can completely win in this game. I supposenobody attaches a very high probability to the contingency I justdescribed, but we constantly are surprised. And I think Steve'sconclusion from my general comment is probably what we would domechanically. We would just in effect start from a higher base,5/20/80feeding out reserves within some limit--in a sense within the $850million that we're behind--should that happen.Before we get to the precise numbers, this does imply that ifwe operate on a path--let's say "A" or "B" at this point--and we don'thave any borrowings, our [instinct] is that if the actual Ms come inbelow whatever path is set, we may have some excess reserves and mayHow farbe pushing down the funds rate. The question then becomes:do we want the funds rate pushed down?The differences between "A"and "B" are not all that great in terms of the short-term fluctuationswe [typically] have, or could easily be exceeded by randomfluctuations. The funds rate constraint may become much moreimportant than which precise path is chosen in the short run. But weare biasing the chances of meeting the bottom end of the funds range.I myself would not want to bias it strongly toward constantly runninginto excess reserves of big amounts if we can avoid it at this point,so that we're constantly operating on a funds rate constraint. Giventhat we're not forsworn to meet the midpoint of a range--and certainlygiven a feeling that if the funds rate goes down, M2 and M3 probablywill be stronger than projected and they are not all that far belowthe ranges now--I would not set the short-run M1 and M-1B targets ashigh as in "B."

Given a balance of all the risks andforces, I think we're talking clearly about something below theI feel that 10 percent is rather close to thepresent constraint.present constraint and that we can live with a constraint lower thanthat. Whether we want to go all the way to 9 percent is a question ofhow much we want to consult.I would be concerned at the moment aboutgoing below 9 percent.I'd feel a little more comfortable, at leastfor an interim period, if we could adopt a technique [similar to what]we used at the last meeting by putting in 9 percent or something likethat with some understanding that if it went below the 9-1/2 to 10percent area, let's say, we could have a telephone check to discusswhether, or at least how promptly, we wanted to go to 9 percent. Ninepercent doesn't bother me particularly, and we have six weeks untilthe next meeting. That's a long period of time, and maybe we willwant the funds rate to go below 9 percent before that next meeting.But as a judgment sitting here at the moment, recognizing that we'reat 10-1/2 percent, I think 9 percent would be a pretty big move in thefor the aggregates that we want to reach over a period of time.ThatPutting in 9 percent now, recognizingthat it can always be changed with some check in the form of aconsultation when it's [somewhat] above 9 percent.

We reallyhaven't had any [occasion] since last October where we have let thefederal funds constraint persist for any period of time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That comes close, in one sense, toalternative A. That could be biased up a bit, but that's the actualprojection now. It may be consistent to bias that up a little interms of the federal funds constraint that we're talking about--tohave a higher federal funds constraint for a slightly higher targetthrough December.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman? Could I raise a question about theIt's my understanding that whiletarget range and the target itself?we set these targets in terms of ranges, we set our objective towardthe midpoint of the range, the implication being that if it got abovethe midpoint we'd be a little nervous and if it got below the midpointI sense now some fudging of this objective of tryingwe'd be nervous.to hit the midpoint of the range. I hear people say it's not themidpoint that's so important as long as we're within the range.That's not my understanding [of what we decided earlier].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I can only answer for myself.Everybody probably has his own opinion; that's how we get agreement onranges. That midpoint is the central tendency of what we're lookingfor when we set the range. That doesn't say, now that it's fivemonths later--and, of course, we'll look at these ranges again inThey could feel morewhat has happened in those five months.comfortable being in the upper half or the lower half or whatever.There is no feeling, certainly in my mind, that there is somethingmagic about keeping a precise midpoint as an absolute targetthroughout the year. Otherwise, we might as well just set a pointtarget and not even look at it in the middle of the year.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. I'd say it's a matter of the point at which onebegins to get nervous.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would say that, certainly, the monthafter we set the target almost any deviation would make one "a littlenervous," in your terms. But I don't think that's inconsistent withsomeone saying six months or eight months later that in the light ofeverything that has happened over those months, he might be nervousabout hitting the midpoint. He might prefer to be above it or hemight prefer to be below it. I don't remember the exact circumstancesbut I do remember that in October we said we wanted to come within therange. At that point we had in mind the upper end of the range, butAnd Inine months had passed [since we set the target for 1979].5/20/80don't think anybody, if they felt nervous at all, felt that being inthe upper part of the range was too high, even though it was the upperpart and not the midpoint of the range that had been set nine monthsearlier.I think that's natural.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. I was thinking about what we decided within thelast two or three months.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I think it's true that in the last two or threemonths we've consistently thought the midpoint of the range remainedabout appropriate. There is a question now, after the big shortfallin April--a much bigger shortfall in M1 than M2 or M3.I don't viewit as a betrayal for somebody to say that under all the circumstanceshe'd now feel more comfortable with growth in the lower part of therange. Indeed, next month we get an opportunity to change the rangeentirely.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. This is the practice of most other centralbanks. They typically, though not always, state ranges; sometimesthey aim at the upper end and sometimes they aim at the lower end.The Swiss do it differently, but the British, the Canadians, and[unintelligible] use a range.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. It's done partly so there is a chance of beingwithin the range. If we have a point target, we're going to miss it.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.I understand that.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. But it's also true that we can say that itdepends on circumstances where within the range we want to fall.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.It's a question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm saying that it's more than givingourselves a safety margin. We may change our emphasis as the yearpasses. Let me try to be more specific, just for operating purposes.I'm proposing setting a short-term range that is probably moreconsistent with "A" than with "B" for the next six weeks, but with acaveat which is more consistent with "B" than with "A."That is, ifthings developed in a way that Ml began exceeding that short-termrange, we would not resist it. We'd even go beyond the implied "B" inthe short run without forcing a significant level of borrowing underthose circumstances.It's an upwardly biased "A," so to speak.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.instructions.Mr. Axilrod will now interpret the-36-5/20/80

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, if I understood the Chairman correctly-and taking a number for purposes of an example--if the Committee saidto focus on May-June at something like a 7 percent growth for M-1A buttolerate higher growth in view of the [April] shortfall, we would seta total reserve path consistent with that 7 percent and a nonborrowedpath roughly equal to the total reserve path because borrowings are atminimal levels. If in the very short run deposits turned out to bestronger, we would raise the path because the Committee said it iswilling to tolerate stronger deposit growth. We wouldn't try to keepto this original path set on 7 percent if higher growth, within theCommittee's own tolerance ranges, suddenly began to develop. So, wewould raise the reserve path in order to [accommodate] that. On theother hand, if the aggregates turned out to be significantly weaker,we would not lower the reserve path. We'd still shoot at thenonborrowed and total reserve paths but that might then call thebottom of the funds rate range into question fairly promptly, whichwould require Committee [consultation].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We may have constraints that areinconsistent when we complete the story, and Mr. Axilrod has justcompleted it in effect. We're saying:Provide enough reserves, whichwe can do reasonably accurately now because we don't have anyborrowings, to meet the base objective; we will tolerate an overshootof that. When we get to the undershoot question, we're going to beconstrained, potentially. If the actual level falls below that path,the question is whether we're going to be constrained by the [lowerlimit of the] federal funds range.On that I'm suggesting 9 percentwith a check at 9-1/2 percent. And it may well be that either anovershoot or an undershoot is going to run into a constraint that theCommittee will want to resolve. We do not have a set ofspecifications that permits the Manager to operate freely between themeetings without potentially running into an inconsistency. I expectwe will be better equipped to resolve an inconsistency later ratherthan now, should one arise. And one could quite well arise.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you're making a guess about what isgoing to happen. That's not Mr. Axilrod's conclusion but you may beright. I won't say you're not right; it could well happen that way.If it does happen that first week, we have the constraint andpresumably at the end of the week we will have to face it.If weoperated a full week under the constraint, then we'd have to considerwhether we wanted to operate another week under the constraint.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, again, that's your presumption. Andit is the presumption of a lot of people around the table. It doesn'thappen to be the presumption of the people who [constructed] the table[in the Bluebook].I tend to agree that it might happen at least in anumber of weeks, but I-MR. PARTEE. Paul, it seems to me that the whole idea ofmoving toward aggregates was to create a situation where we wouldn'thave to depend on presumptions.I'm not saying that Steve is wrongbut the whole idea of having a wider range is to make it possible toflex as developments occur, without depending on a staff forecast.

MR. BLACK. We have very little basis for knowing where thelower level ought to be, or the upper level really. The problem islikely to be on the lower end, but it could be on the upper end.

MR. PARTEE. Well, [we stopped] at 10-1/2 percent.Over thelast two weeks we were way short on reserves and we stopped [supplyingadditional reserves] on account of the 10-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.time, I don't think.We were[not]short of the path at that

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, clearly, we would have had to call aconsultation on Thursday or Friday if a meeting weren't scheduled fortoday. We had a consultation the week before and that range thenbecame a limiting factor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.I don't mean to suggest that these rangesnever were a limiting factor for a few days.I'm saying that as soonas they became a limiting factor for a few days we had a consultationand we changed [the range], with the possible exception of that 20percent situation. We would have had a consultation if the 20 percentrate had lasted for another few days, I think, but the rate turned[down] before--[from]

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Yes, but at 13 percent we raised it last time11 to 13 percent and went a couple of days with the 13 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. As I say, we've gone a couple of days-three or four days at times or maybe a whole week--where the range hashad some influence.Eventually we've had a consultation and the rangehas been changed. I don't mean to suggest it hasn't had someinfluence in the short run. All I'm saying is that when it has had aconstraining influence long enough to [trigger] a consultation, we-40-5/20/80have changed it. It may well have an influence this time, but whatwe're talking about is an influence for a week and then having aconsultation.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I don't know if this would behelpful to Governor Teeters, but perhaps she's worrying that if thebottom of the range were stipulated at 9 percent rather than 8 percentit might be an inhibiting factor in the speed with which we approachthe bottom of the range. I don't think it would affect operations.That is, we wouldn't try to hold the rate at 9-1/2 percent because thebottom of the range was 9 as compared with 8 percent. We'd go aheadand provide reserves until we hit the bottom and we'd have aconsultation. It wouldn't inhibit the process of getting there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't mean to suggest at all that theselimits, if we ran into them, would not be effective for some daysuntil we consult. I'm just saying that every time we've had aconsultation we have in fact changed the range. The history is one ofnot sticking to these ranges between meetings.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Well, I'm reacting to Frank's point that if wevote [for a lower limit] too close to the 10-1/2 percent, we would begoing back too rigidly to setting interest rate targets. I thinkoverride us at some point, so we might as well have the leeway to ridewith the market even if we consult on every half point as the rategoes down on whether we want it to move down that next half point. Ijust think we would look better with a wider range.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. The range is being narrowed from [6 points] toeither 5 or 4 points, which is a whale of narrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're talking pure cosmetics--whatappears in the record of this meeting. We're not talking about purecosmetics when we're talking about what the bottom of the range shouldbe because that may become the effective rate and we're going to havea consultation to see whether we want to change it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, I'd rather have the cosmetics look rightand have a wider range and have an understanding that there is a touchpoint that we wouldn't go through without a consultation, if Murraywill let us do that short of recording it in the Policy Record.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).Somebody tells me this is being tape recorded.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN. We have in the past had some reference [in thePolicy Record] to the notion of a consultation but I think if [theunderstanding] were so specific as to be a checkpoint, it probablyought to be in the Policy Record.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We actually did specifically have that?Was it for the last meeting or the previous meeting?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.We didn't have a figure in the last--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't remember [if it was] this lastmeeting or the meeting before, but we were rather specific about it.5/20/80

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).Yes.We did it differently.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Let me retract the word checkpoint. Can we saythere's a zone through which we would not wish to pass withoutconsidering together the implications of such a passage?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.Would you refer to this as the twilight zone?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.I think if the Committee indicates as it passesthrough that zone that it doesn't see a need to change the fundamentalrange, Mr. Altmann might not view it as a vote that needs to bereported.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN. That has been the practice.to be regular, it probably should be a vote.I think if it gets

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.I guess that is the difference. When wedid it the other time, we did not vote. We had a consultation withouta vote, right?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.It was April 29th, wasn't it?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Yes, [when the funds rate was] at 16 percentthe Committee met and, though it met, it decided [to retain the rangein] the directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right, we didn't have a vote.think that is the difference.I

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. And there was no vote on the 16 percent, as amatter of fact.It was just an understanding that at 15 or 16percent, whatever it was-MS. TEETERS.16.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.The point at which the consultation--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Why don't you let individual members of theCommittee call you when they think that Chuck's zone is beingapproached? And when more than half have called, you can call aconsultation.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).What if he can't be reached, Henry?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN. The rules of procedure provide that threemembers can request that a meeting be called.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.Three members?He'll spend all his time on the phone!

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY. Mr. Chairman, if I understand the way we haveoperated in the past, if we have a consultation and the rate is withinthe range established by the Committee, then no vote is taken at thatconsultation. Isn't that correct, Murray?5/20/80

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.I think that's what it amounts to.There doesn't need to be a vote.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY. Well, I don't believe there ever has been one.There has only been a vote when we've lowered or raised the range fromwhat the Committee set at the meeting. Therefore, I would be opposedto setting a range now with a lower limit below 9 percent. And Iwould also like the caveat the Chairman has put forth that there beconsultation at 9-1/2 percent. At this point I feel fairly stronglythat a federal funds rate below 9 percent would not be acceptable.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I think it's more than the process.There is a very fundamental issue at this stage. The way this meetingis going and the way opinion is apparently evolving, we are gettingright back to setting interest rate ranges and the stabilization ofinterest rates, and I could not go along with that. I think we'returning the corner, all for the worse, to right back where we were.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.There is no compromise, either.Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We will unquestionably have a differenceof opinion at that end of the table, anyway. But I think we've got toresolve it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, there's another question we need todeal with, and that is whether we mention specific short-run numericaltargets in the directive. If we narrow the ranges and don't mentionany targets, it's going to be viewed as more than cosmetic when peoplefind that out. I think they will conclude essentially what Larry hasstated. I would urge us to put down whatever we agree to in the wayof numerical targets rather than leave that blank and specify merelythe federal funds range.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.We have been doing that, haven't we?Yes we have.[I thought] 7 percent growth in M-1A was thetarget.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have a [draft] directive that iswritten in more general language. I'm not sure I'm completely happywith it but I can't think of an alternative. Mr. Axilrod could notthink of an alternative. If someone has a bright idea, we can-MR. AXILROD. The alternative was to put down 7 percent, say,if that's what you voted for. It would be stated in the Policy Recordvery clearly that 7 percent was the target but that you would permitsome overshoot. Our thought behind not putting specifically in thedirective a number for growth over a two- or three-month period wasthat it would be better understood in the Policy Record where it wouldbe surrounded by the analysis of the shortfall and all that. So wetried to phrase the directive to reflect what we thought the Committeemight be trying to do in general, which was to [foster an increase]back into its range, and leave the specificity to the Policy Record.-43-5/20/80We could put the specifics back in there, and they'd appear at thesame time [as the directive was released as part of the PolicyRecord.].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The presumption was that the specificsthat Steve had in mind would be in the Policy Record. The alternativewas putting in at least 7 to 7-1/2 percent [in the directive] and somelanguage saying that we'd tolerate some growth above that. Now, we'retalking about the period before the next meeting only.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Yes, that's the other thing that bothered me alittle because [that would cover] only two months and that seemed likeIt gives aa very short period to focus on particular aggregates.sense of short-run control over the aggregates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suppose we could say just what you have"In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reservehere:aggregates consistent with growth of M-1A...."And then we can say that in theout the "over a period of months."period before the next meeting, or over the two months, the aim willbe to achieve growth of at least 7 to 7-1/2 percent with sometolerance for growth above that.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think it's a bad precedent to startbeing that specific in the public record. I'm not arguing now for anyI'm just talking in terms of the long run.particular policy.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.We're going to miss it, you know, one way or theother.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.We might miss it and, of course--"...seeks expansion over the next

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. We could say:two months of M-1A, M-1B and M2 at rates high enough to promoteIt impliesachievement of the Committee's long-run objectives."higher growth than the long-run targets without being at all specificabout it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. We can say "growth over the first nine months of1980" or something like that, essentially what we've done in the past.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I vote for keeping Steve's language.I think we'll get into less trouble later on.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Well, it's really not at all specific.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.What was your language, Governor Partee?"Seeks growth in these aggregates over the next

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.two months at rates high enough to promote achievement of theThen we could [cite] the monetaryCommittee's longer run objectives."growth over the first nine months of the year, or something like that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'd have to put in some modifier aboutover what period of time, because otherwise it would sound as if inthe next two months we are going to--5/20/80-44-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, to seek growth over the next two monthsat a rate high enough to promote achievement of the Committee's longrun objectives implies the whole year. Or you could go to a ninemonth [figure].We were trying to avoid deciding at this pointwhether you were getting back in the range by September or December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I think we ought to be specific and say "promoteits longer-run objectives for the year" or something like that.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Yes, that's what we had in mind.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Everybody has a gut feeling. My gutfeeling is that we're going to find M2 and M3 coming up better than Mlin terms of the targets.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Well, they did when the money supply wasrunning so fast last summer. They've been within their targets allalong.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. M3 has touched the upper end and the lowerend, but has remained well within the [band] on average, which is morethan M1 has done. Well, we have a substantive question to decidehere. I take it that wording of the directive is reasonable?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.But we have to have point estimates for ourgrowth targets for May-June in order to establish some reserve[objectives].You never specified what you wanted those to be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Policy Record?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Well, no I didn't.Those point estimates would appear in theNo, for voting purposes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm saying 7 to 7-1/2 percent, I suppose,but with tolerance on the up side.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.What about M-1B?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm just working off Steve's numbers.had what--a little less than 8 percent for M-1B?You

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, 7-1/2 to 8 percent [for M-1B] would beconsistent with 7 to 7-1/2 percent for M-1A. And for M2 I would say7-3/4 to 8-1/4 percent would be consistent.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.So you are going the alternative A route?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is broadly consistent withalternative A, with a willingness to overshoot.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.If fortune should smile on us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.At this point I don't know what fortune-45-5/20/80

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.What is the M2 consistent with that?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Around 8 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're talking about figures for the actualpath. That's not quite the equivalent of the figures [mentionedhere], which are for a longer period. We're just talking about nowthrough the meeting date in July.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.Yes.Logic would have[unintelligible].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In a completely symmetrical world, but I'mnot playing in a symmetrical world right now.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, you have taken the fed fundsrange that is consistent with the staff's alternative B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.With "B."That is correct.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In fact, if you want to make theswitch, I think we could do it the other way.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. And you want to put in a 9 percent funds ratewith consultation at 9-1/2 percent, did you say?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, [we'd consult] before we get there,figuring that that's more than a full [percentage point] drop in thefederal funds rate.It may well come next week. I don't know forsure whether it will.It will depend on what our money supply figuresshow, so we don't know yet. And the significance of what rate we putin there is probably what Roger said--it [determines] when we need aformal vote of the Committee to lower the rate as opposed to aconsultation. Well, let's just try it out.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.A show of hands?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, a show of hands on acceptability iswhat we're looking for at this point. Are the specifications clear?These do not appear in the directive, [except] the one for the federalfunds range. On the others, we have the general language in thedirective. We have a reserve target which we expect is almostcertainly consistent with no borrowing, with tolerance on the up sidebecause if some borrowing developed, we presumably would raise thepath. So unless we have an extremely strong rebound in the moneysupply, we're talking about no significant borrowing during thisperiod--only frictional levels of borrowing. Let me just try the 9percent [lower limit for the] funds rate. I don't think the 14 percent[upper limit] is real, but let's maintain it for visual [purposes].I don't even know.What is the range now?

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.It's 10-1/2 to 19 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).We still have 19?We lowered that.5/20/80-46

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.19 percent.No we didn't; it was only [lowered from] 20 to

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're making this tremendous 5percentage point drop in interest rates, Larry! It's an enormoustolerance, which we really-MR. ROOS. In other words, we're narrowing the rangesignificantly, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).We're back to where we started out in October.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How many find that acceptable? One, two,three, four, five. I thought it was you who proposed it, Emmett?

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. No. The funds rate range is what I proposed, butnot the money growth target.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.You want a higher path?Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The [problem]inconsistent with this funds rate.is that [a higher path] is

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. I want alternative B both with respect to theaggregates and the funds range. I have accepted the funds rangespecified here as consistent with the [higher] growth ranges [ofalternative B].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're not talking about this September/early part of July.

MR. RICE. I know, but that relates to whether we're going toget back [to the target range] in September or in December.

MR. MORRIS. Also, an implication is that if the numbers comein higher, we are not going to push the funds rate up.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.alternative?That is correct.Well, who has an

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. My alternative would be to raise the point[targets] for M-1A, M-1B, and M2 to make them essentially themidpoints between alternative A and alternative B for the 2-monthperiod and to establish an 8 percent lower end on the funds raterather than 9 percent. That would be my suggestion.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.Quick consultation, say, at 9-1/2 percent?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. We would be reviewing it. The Chairman couldcall for a telephone conference as we got down into the lower end ofthe funds range, yes. I wouldn't want to be too specific becauseMurray might make us put it in the Policy Record. But the Chairman-47-5/20/80could have a call at 9-1/2 percent, as the rate was moving from 9-1/2to 9 percent, with an 8 percent limit on the published range.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think that represents areasonable compromise.I am sympathetic with the Chairman's need toform some kind of consensus, given the difference in views. That tipsit very heavily toward the view you expressed earlier, Chuck; it's nota reasonable compromise.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Well, I'd compromise between alternative A andalternative B.I spoke in terms of alternative B.I would ratherhave a funds rate of 7 percent; I just specified a funds rate of 8percent. I compromised compared with what I would otherwise havedone. He asked if there were any suggestions and that was mysuggestion.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Another thing we can do to compromise furtheris to take your specifications of 7 to 7-1/2 percent and so on for theMs and to make [the funds range] 8-1/2 to 14 percent.
