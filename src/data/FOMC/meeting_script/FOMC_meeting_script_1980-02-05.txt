CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will call the non-meeting to order. Weare not in a meeting at this point anyway; we may be in a meetinglater. I would just remind all of you that I sent out a memorandum onthe idea of possibly changing the [FOMC] meeting dates.It probablywould amount to having fewer meetings on the theory that with thecurrent operating procedure, I sense--maybe nobody else senses--that ameeting after only four weeks doesn't give us much evidence on whichto change anything. With lagged reserve accounting and with a lag inthe numbers, we're hardly in the period that we were discussing beforethe next meeting comes along.So there may be some logic in doing ita bit differently. This is partly based on the idea, after looking itover--and I think we all agree--that we need a little longerperspective.It seems to me better to get the longer perspective bysticking to calendar quarters rather than just always looking threemonths ahead on some kind of moving average basis.If we take that asan assumption, logically we should meet somewhere around the beginningof a quarter and look at that quarter. We can review it sometimeduring the quarter and also look ahead to the next quarter. Then whenwe get to the end of the quarter, we will be looking ahead at the nextquarter. There seems to be a certain logical progression in thatmethod of looking at it as opposed to meeting more frequently when thebasic decision was whether or not to change the federal funds rate.But I will return to the subject at the end of the meeting and then[we will decide].There's nothing magic about any particular time tochange.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Well, there is some magic in it.I looked atyour [proposed] schedule and I thought that we probably should meet atthe very end of the quarter to plan for the next quarter. Then Irealized that we have constraints on two [meeting dates].One isbecause of the budget and the [President's] economic report [and] theHumphrey-Hawkins testimony; so we have to wait until January to dothat one.Then we have a similar constraint in July when we have towait for the midyear review of the budget before we can do very much.I finally came around to your schedule on two of the quarters anyway.So, we might as well change the whole schedule into a similar pattern.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I had nothing invested in any of theparticular dates or when we would change, if we change.But I do havethe feeling that every four weeks is a little frequent if we areoperating in this particular mode.I wouldn't feel that way if wewere operating more on money market oriented criteria.

Forinstance, for that proposed April 1, which looks logical except forAnd we couldbasically have the same pattern by meeting on March 18th, because I2/4-5/80understand [that date is on] everybody's schedule now, although thatwould leave a longer lapse before the next meeting.

MR. ROOS.Is there supposed to be a response?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, you can wait until later; it can waituntil after the meeting tomorrow. I just wanted to remind you to haveit in mind so that if you have any strong feelings they could beadequately verbalized tomorrow.The first thing on our agenda today is lagged reserveaccounting. Mr. Axilrod.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, lagged reserve accounting, as thePresidents and Board Members know, has been a subject of considerablecontention in the System since it was adopted in 1968.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're going to get an issue pretty soonfor which we just can't pull out the old memoranda.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. That's what I was getting to. There has beenconsiderable contention since 1968 when it was adopted. And I mustsay from an internal perspective there was contention between 1966 and1968, when it was being studied for adoption under a rather differentinstitutional environment and different operating procedures than wenow have. Various staff groups have studied this since 1973. I amafraid you are not quite getting independent results since I think Iwas Chairman of three of those groups. And they all three unanimouslyconcluded that there is very little to be said for lagged reserveaccounting from a monetary policy point of view if the Committee isoperating on a reserves target. One can't make a case that it is theleast bit of help and one can make a case that it is harmful. Therehave been divergences among the staff even in that context of it notbeing helpful. The question is: How harmful in fact is it? Somewould contend more strongly than others that it's harmful over thelonger run. Others would contend that it doesn't matter over thelonger run: That with or without lagged reserve accounting we canperk along on a reserve target and manage to hit our objectives. Ithink that's a legitimate source of dispute because the long run iscompounded of a number of short runs. And in a very simple-mindedsense in any 1-week period there is no defined relationship betweenthe multiplier on deposits and reserves in that week. That is,reserves this week can bear any relationship to deposits because allone has to do is worry about two weeks from now. So we rely almostentirely, therefore, on banks' responses to interest rates to controldeposits. When you cut through it all, fundamentally that is nodifferent from relying on a fluctuating federal funds rate target.So, I personally would tend to take the view that lagged reserveaccounting can make it virtually impossible to hit our targets in theshort run and probably is of some importance in making it difficult tohit our targets in the long run. Thus, I think it is really quiteinconsistent with the present operating procedures. Now, I don't meanto say that there aren't other things that are equally difficult. Thediscount window is a problem and our own graduated reserve requirementstructure is a problem. But in the latter regard, some of Mr.Lindsey's research would suggest that lagged reserve accounting2/4-5/80accounts for bigger divergences in the multiplier from predictionsthan does the graduated reserve requirement structure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.From Mr. Who's research?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Mr. Lindsey, on my right. So I would say thatwhile doing away with lagged reserve requirements is not going tosolve all our problems in hitting the aggregates, it at least lookslike a step in the right direction. In view of this cogent staffanalysis, one might be curious as to the reason no action has beentaken to date. I assume there have been two reasons. One was thatwith the federal funds rate operating target, which has been theprincipal System operating target for years, or even with a netborrowed reserves operating target, lagged reserve requirements areessentially an irrelevancy, like almost any reserve requirement is anirrelevancy. With a funds rate target, the Committee is simply tryingto aim at that interest rate which will cause all the adjustments bybanks and the public, whether or not there are reserve requirements,that will bring about the proper money supply. So in that sense it'sirrelevant. The other issue was membership. The lagged reserverequirement is viewed as a benefit of membership. To test that viewwe did run a survey during one of these staff analyses and, except forthose at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, all of the directors ofReserve Banks who represented member banks said lagged reserveaccounting was desirable. In St. Louis, the directors said it wasundesirable.

One is moving from a two-week lag to a one-weeklag, which would presumably speed up the response of the bankingsystem a bit. The second is making reserve requirementscontemporaneous for Reserve City banks and leaving a lag for the other5,000 banks. And the third is an essentially contemporaneous schemefor all banks. Without going through all the reasons that aredetailed in the memo, Mr. Chairman, we did conclude that we see verylittle advantage to any move now except the move to contemporaneousaccounting for all banks.That is,if the Board did not feel disposedto move toward contemporaneous accounting now, for whatever reasons,the staff would not suggest taking either of the other twoalternatives. We believe that their advantages do not outweigh thedisadvantages that might be entailed in terms of messed-up reporting,failure to quell the public debate, and certain problems of the2/4-5/80multiplier that the mix system brings about. Those are all thecomments I have, unless Mr. Lindsey would wish to add something.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you have not left a lot of doubt asto where you stand, Mr. Axilrod. Is there any dissenting opinionamong the staff on the importance of this matter?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY. I might say that, if anything, my views aremore extreme than Steve's.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In the articles and academic papers and soforth that have been written on this subject, do they bring anythingto light or make any argument that you have not made?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY. No, in preparing these memoranda for the Board,we thoroughly reviewed the literature starting from the early '70s on.My own view, which isn't particularly humble, is that the quality ofthe analysis presented here is much superior to the academic work.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would expect that! Well, it's justthat the conclusion comes through a little more strongly than I readit in that memorandum itself. I had a feeling that you saw somedisadvantages in the degree of certainty with which the Desk wasoperating. Maybe Mr. Sternlight would like to comment.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes, I'd like to add a word or two. I feelmuch less convinced than Mr. Axilrod that there would be significantbenefits from a switch to contemporaneous accounting. I can see thetheoretical case that he makes. I'd be among those who feel that inthe longer run even that theoretical case makes very little, if any,difference. I can see some impediments to the Desk's operations undera contemporaneous system in that we don't know required reserves inthe week we're operating in. Perhaps more significant than that, whensome deviation in required reserves stems from a factor other than thebehavior of the monetary aggregates--for example, a bulge in interbankdeposits or something of that nature that essentially we would want toaccommodate rather than resist as part of our reserve targeting--Ithink contemporaneous accounting could send us off in a perversedirection. So, I came out feeling that there is not all that muchadvantage to it. And having the minus on the membership side--I don'tknow how strongly to evaluate it, but I am told that it still doeshave some significance--just made me pretty dubious about thedesirability of a change.after.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Holmes, you were there before andDo you have any comments?

[SECTION]

MR. HOLMES. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I can recall back in thegreat debate over whether we should have lagged reserve accounting,all sorts of claims were made that it was going to help the Desktremendously and that the Wednesday [settlement date] would be astable day in the funds market. We at the Desk never believed that.But, if it does make a difference for bank relations and on thatground alone it is useful to the banks, then we see no harm in thelagged reserve accounting. I feel very much as Peter does that itdoesn't make all that much difference. It seems to me that the Systemhas introduced enough other changes recently in statistics and inprocedures that I see no urgent need, certainly, to go ahead with a2/4-5/80move back to contemporaneous reserve accounting.doubt if it really makes that much difference.Along with Peter, I

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I have long felt that if we'regoing to have a reserve operating base, sooner or later we are goingto have to move to contemporaneous reserves. As one example, let'ssay that later on this year we get into a period where the moneyThat would mean that insupply is not growing or is contracting.order to hit our target of total reserves, the Desk would have to pushin very large amounts of excess reserves at the expense of a prettysharp reduction in the funds rate. That might look a little funny ifwe're willing to do it, but it is one of the consequences stemmingfrom lagged reserves.It is very awkward to control reserves with alagged system. On the other hand, this is a very awkward time for usto make a change. As far as I am concerned, it's only a matter oftiming--of when we do it.I don't think this is an optimum time,first because of the membership bill.I wouldn't want to throwanything on the fire that could in any way interfere with that bill.I'd want to hold off until it has been decided one way or the other.Second, all of our computer systems people in the whole FederalReserve System are [working] flat out. We have the system automationprogram and we have the work going forward in connection with thepricing of Federal Reserve services. At least in the Boston Bank, wedon't have any capacity to do the work on [a shift from laggedreserves].And I think that is probably true around the System.

MR. BALLES.I'd strongly support what Frank has said. Onthe substance of the argument, I certainly join Steve; that's exactlywhere I come out.Like Frank, I would also stress that it would bevery risky in my opinion even to raise this outside the Fed until weget a membership bill passed because there will be some adverse memberbank relations in a transition. Secondly, I'd stress that both thebanks and the Reserve Banks need a long lead time on this, longer thanSteve thinks based on the impression I have from the staff memo. Iwould think six months would be an absolute minimum. When you thinkof banks in the West with statewide systems and 1,000 branches and soforth, it gets to be a very, very complicated system of reporting.2/4-5/80

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Well, both for the banks and for us for thereason that Frank said. Our data processing people within the ReserveBanks have been knocked flat by the tremendous number of changes inthe current reporting series, by the cranking up of IBA, and by themembership bill on the horizon, which will bring us a lot moreinstitutions to deal with. On top of that, all at the same time, ifwe try to plug in a very detailed, cumbersome, time consuming,expensive reprogramming effort and try to do it too quickly, I thinkwe'll rue the day we did it. I'll tell you this: (1) I would hopethat a decision would be made to move to contemporaneous reserverequirements; (2) I wouldn't even raise the issue unless we get amembership bill; and (3) then at that point, I'd make sure that plentyof study is given to lead time needs of both the banks and the ReserveBanks.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think your caution is well taken and Idid it with some hesitancy. Mr. Mayo.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. Well, most of my speech has already been given.But I would say of the three alternatives Steve presented, I certainlywould agree with the staff, or the reserve requirements policy group,that a return to contemporaneous reserve accounting would be thepreferred solution. I think it is better than lagged reserves. But Itoo feel, though I probably can't say it as eloquently as John justdid, that it very definitely ties into the membership bill, and Iwould postpone it if only for that reason. I also feel, even though Iam known around this table as a pragmatist or eclectic or something-no comment Mr. Roos--that there are two other ways that have not beenthoroughly presented and discussed by the Axilrod Committee but shouldbe. They have been subjected to a lot of good academic thought.and I think they're worthy of discussion. One of them is Bill Poole'spaper, Frank, on what amounts to a 100 percent marginal reserverequirement on the most recent changes since the last determination.The other is the idea of some sort of reverse lag where, as we alllearned in our elementary money and banking text books, the FederalReserve or the Central Bank sets the reserves. That isn't as silly asit may sound. We are not saying to a bank that it can't accept anymore deposits because its reserves have already been set. That can behandled by the way it works through the accounting system. But itseems to me that both of those ideas have enough merit that they atleast ought to be kicked around a little more by the SRAC and bySteve's group. So, while I agree that the major reason for delayingthe implementation of this relates to the membership issue and thetiming, I would suggest that we have a little more work to do in termsof analyzing these two ideas, just as examples. And if we want toblow holes in them, let's do it. But some of us, at least, areintrigued by these two ideas and the possibility that, if they work,2/4-5/80they will bring us closer, though obviously not completely, to a chaindrive rather than a belt drive, if I may use that [analogy].

[SECTION]

MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, like Bob, my speech has beenI think it would bepretty well given. I'll start with a conclusion:a mistake to make a change right now. There are several reasons. Inaddition to the ones that have been given, I think the magnitude ofthe problem has not been demonstrated to be great enough to justifythe cost of a change at this time. We knew when we made the changeyears ago to lagged reserve accounting that it would have the effectit is having. But at that point we judged that the membershipbenefits overrode the negative effects it would have on the linkagebetween the policy target and achieving the target.It seems to methat the balance today is even stronger in the direction of membershipthan it was at the time we made the change. And my recollection isthat the views we received from the Manager of the System Account thenwere the same as have been expressed today. The Desk did not see itas presenting an insurmountable operating problem. As to thesuggestion that it's irrelevant if we're operating with a federalfunds target, I find that persuasive. But it does seem to me thatit's inappropriate to throw into the same box the net borrowed reservetarget. That seems to me a different animal than the federal fundstarget. And the suggestion that we have to achieve the monetaryaggregate target through interest rate effects is a part of anyoperating procedure.The people who borrow from banks and the bankofficials who are handling banks' investment decisions are operatingin response to interest rates. And it's through the interface of thebanks and their customers that the asset side of their balance sheetis affected, and then the liability side seems to me to flow fromthat.So we cannot escape working through the interest rates in theI thinkthat's true whether we try to work through some reserve aggregate or afederal funds target or a net borrowed reserve target.It comes downto our ability, whatever the target, [to determine] the linkagebetween [our objectives] and the aggregate we attempt to affect.Butin the final analysis [the key is] our willingness to let our effortsinfluence interest rates in the market.Along with Bob's reference to a couple of items and gimmicksin the literature, I was expecting to see at least some passingreference--to use the vernacular on the table--to a "gimmick" that waskicked around fairly extensively a number of years ago:namely,grouping banks into about five groups and having their reservesettlement dates come up on a different day of the week.2/4-5/80

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, in deciding whether lagged reservesare good or bad for policy, I think we have to decide whether thelikely errors in hitting the money supply stem from a lack ofresponsiveness to changes in the volume of reserves or whether theystem from unexpected changes in the appetite of the market for moneyof the type that Frank Morris assumed. If it's the first, then onecan make a case that we get a little quicker response under laggedreserve requirements than under the other in the sense that if weinject a given volume of reserves, required reserves don't riseimmediately, so the banks feel a little easier and they kick this offa little faster. In the case of unexpected deviations stemming from ashift in the demand for money, then we do have an automatic brakingthat comes about under contemporaneous reserve requirements that tendsto stop this unexpected change in the demand for money. I think it'sthis latter type that's really the most troublesome for us under ourpresent mode of operation. So that does give a slight edge tocontemporaneous accounting under the present procedures. But I don'tthink we ought to overemphasize that. I come out very close to whereAlan Holmes and Peter Sternlight did. At most, I would think thedelay would be two weeks. And if you accept any of the points that2/4-5/80Irving Auerbach was raising in his debate with Bill Poole in theAmerican Banker, then you may conclude that it may take longer thanmost people assume for these multiple contractions or expansions inbank credit to take place. In the kind of environment in which we aretrying to bring about a steady rate of expansion in money, and givenall these other slippages in the monetary multiplier, it's hard for meto see that it makes a great deal of difference under presentprocedures. But I do think that it is good for us, if we can, toquiet this criticism that has been stemming from the monetarists. I(1) It would divert their efforts toward trying tohave two reasons:help us achieve a monetary target and they would stop assuming thatit's as easy to hit as most of them have assumed; and (2) it wouldremove any excuse that we have for not hitting the targets. And bothof those [results] would be rather salutary, I think.As far as the other side of the coin is concerned, bankrelations, a lot of the academic commentators assume that it's easierfor a bank to adjust under contemporaneous reserve requirementsbecause it does not involve as large a change in excess reserves. Butthey are not talking to the bankers I've talked to. I think most ofthe Reserve Banks now provide each of their banks with a dailystatement on reserves, which shows their required reserves asdetermined from deposits two weeks earlier. They subtract from thatany vault cash they held two weeks earlier, either add to that orsubtract from it the amount of carryover from the previous week, andthen show how much the banks must hold in their reserve balances forthe remainder of the reserve period. In fact, we even show that on adaily average basis. So far as the small banker is concerned, all hehas to worry about is looking at that statement that comes every day,early in the day--it never misses its schedule except when the carrierdoesn't run, which is very seldom--and he knows exactly the reserveshe has to hold on a daily average basis for the balance of thatreserve period. And if he misses it a little, he has the 2 percentcarryover. Most of them, if they watch it very closely, can getpretty darn close to zero excess reserves. But I wouldn't favor theadoption of alternative one--moving to a one-week lag--which I thinkis the best of those Steve outlined, for the reason that John Ballesand Frank Morris and many of the rest of you have stated. It would bea major problem [of implementation]. But as we move ahead, we mightthink about how we could go to contemporaneous reserve accounting andyet solve this bank relations problem. The problem doesn't stementirely from not having all the banks as members. I don't think we'dwant to burden the banks unduly even if they were all [members].So, what appeals to me most would be a month-long period ofcontemporaneous reserve accounting. I think that would havepractically all of the advantages of the [weekly contemporaneousIt would involve less rate volatility becauseaccounting period].banks would have more opportunity to engage in interest arbitragewithin the reserve period. It would also give more time for thisadjustment to the changes in the demand for money--that multiplecontraction or expansion that some of the commentators seem to thinkoccurs almost instantaneously. It would reduce the work of theFederal Reserve and the work of the commercial banks a great deal ifwe didn't have to put this out on a weekly basis. It would reduce theemphasis on the weekly figures that now cause us so much problems.And if we eliminated the carryover in the process--and I think we-10-2/4-5/80probably could get away with eliminating that if we went to a monthlong period--it would eliminate a form of slippage. But there aresome disadvantages to a month-long period without the carryover interms of unexpected reserve movements toward the end of the period.And this would not be simply the last day in the case of many banksthat don't know their required reserves until five or six days later.But if we did have an unexpected movement toward the end of theperiod, it would have an effect on only 1/28th to 1/31st of the wholeperiod because of the month-long period as compared with an effect of1/7th as we now have with a seven-day period. We also could notprovide as much help to the banks through giving them statements oftheir required reserves, and that removes one of the inducements forthem to report more promptly to us. Certainly that is important tous. Finally, with a long period of time, in a sense one could arguethat the banks wouldn't have to come to grips with a change in reserveavailability quite as promptly, and we might have some slippage there.But on balance, if we combined these two, that might conceivably bethe best of the two worlds. But I would urge that we not move to thatat this time for reasons others have already stressed.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Well, those were very thoughtful observationsby Bob Black. I just would like to make two points on those before Ibriefly say what I meant to. I am not sure that we'll satisfy themonetarists by this change. I think their reasoning is that they wantto minimize Desk operations. They believe that with contemporaneousaccounting all the adjustment can take place through a change indeposits and none of the reserve needs have to be met by Deskoperations. You pointed out that these adjustments of levels ofdeposits don't take place instantaneously. We need a very largechange for each dollar of reserves, something like a $10 change indemand deposits and a $20 change in time deposits. These changes arereally so large that they can't take place quickly; any reservedeficiency or surplus must still be met very predominantly from Deskoperations. My other reaction is that the one-month procedure soundslike an ingenious possibility and well worth studying, but one can seeSuppose wethe danger of slippage if we expanded this [time period].made it not one month but one year. One can see that that wouldn't beworkable. So somewhere between a day and a year there is an optimumin terms of less disturbance but also less loss of effectiveness.As far as moving to a contemporaneous basis right away isconcerned, I think the gain we have in terms of the monetarists'analysis wouldn't be very great. The staff memorandum convinces methat the gain in terms of speed might be very considerable. Theeffects of any reserve shortage begin two weeks earlier unless we wantto assume that somehow a reserve shortage or surplus casts its shadowahead and the banks move into very short-term assets as soon as theysee their deposits moving in one direction or another. But that isn'tvery likely because all they see is their own deposits moving; theydon't see the aggregate moving necessarily. So, there does seem to bea significant advantage in terms of speed of adjustment and I thinkthat is important because even though we say that it really doesn'tmatter over a quarter or so whether we deviate from our target, it isalways very hard to get back on track. It doesn't matter if wedeviate if we indeed get back on track. Nothing happens to the real-11-2/4-5/80sector. But getting back on track may be very painful because theforces that pushed us off may still be operative.I have one question on something that I'd like to understandbetter. I have the impression that under the present procedure, thefunds rate still serves as a guide to reserve needs. Peter seemed tosay that if we move to contemporaneous, we would lose that. Atpresent, a movement in the funds rate is an unambiguous indicationthat reserves are either too large or too small and it is clear thatthe Desk must take action unless it wants to have the reserveimbalance met by borrowing or repayment. If we have contemporaneous,then a move in the funds rate may mean indeed that market factors haveproduced a deficiency or excess of reserves. But it also may meanthat the aggregates are moving in a particular direction, creating areserve surplus or deficiency. If the latter is the case, we may notwant to counteract that; we may want to let the change in the fundsrate do its job. Say a decline in deposits leads to a decline in thefunds rate. We would want the decline in the funds rate to help pushdeposits back up. So there seems to be a possibility of using thefunds rate as a guide to operations under lagged [accounting] and lessof a possibility to do that under contemporaneous. Since I amtroubled, frankly, by the use of the funds rate as a guide tooperations because it exposes us to the appearance of still being on afunds rate target, I wonder whether this wouldn't protect us againstthat suspicion that we're trying to control the funds rate rather thannonborrowed reserves and the aggregates. And I wonder whether theDesk wouldn't be able to judge what it needs to do--determine the needto add reserves or the absence of a need--without this indicationcoming from the funds rate.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN. Well, I have the feeling that the honeymoon of ourexperiment is about over. Consequently, I get a little more itchy tofiddle with the machinery rather than to let it stand. I am convincedthat the acceptance of the Federal Reserve making this [procedure]work is going to be more important than for membership and a wholehost of issues. I would not back off because of the effect it mayhave on the membership legislation at this time. This is moreimportant than the membership issue. I am convinced that while thereare programming problems involved, we can get it done faster than weassume if we change our priorities a bit. I would give up on some ofthe other things we are doing, I think, and put this in place. I amnot sure how much time [it would take] but the biggest problem isgetting the Banks to rearrange their priorities in order to mesh withit. I would pick up on some of the other comments about theimportance of saying that this [procedure] works. I am concerned thatthe slippages are going to show up much more. There is a lack ofconfidence in the market now about what we are doing and either [weneed to do] that or look at the discount rate again, or perhaps both,very promptly or I think we are going to be in trouble.I would like to raise one question. With [the development]of the managed liabilities and RPs and other things, are we seeing achange in the adjustment process now that will [become morepronounced] if we start to tighten? Are we seeing that [adjustmentnot] formally showing up in the deposit base but in some of theseitems? I get lost in all the accounting as to how that flushes out.2/4-5/80-12-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. We have often expected that when the Systemtightens, there will be an increase in managed liabilities that holdsdown demand deposits. For example, there would be an increase inissuance of CDs and RPs and all that. That didn't turn out to be truein the fourth quarter when there seemed to be a sharp reduction inbank credit demands. But for unchanged credit demands, so to speak, Iwould expect that to be an element in the adjustment process. Itwould be an aspect of the tightening--issuing [such] things andputting upward pressure on interest rates in so doing.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. If we shift from lagged reserve accounting tocontemporaneous and confuse that issue-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, I speak somewhat tentatively on thissubject which I have observed raging around here for many years. Itis somewhat religious in character. By the way, St Louis, I think hasalways been on the side of the angels, Larry! They might have had alittle falling off or-MR. ROOS.Steve tells me we were the only people--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I would say you were always in favor ofcontemporaneous accounting and I would say that Bob Black has alwaysbeen against it because he saw the public relations cost or the bankrelations cost. The latter was a major factor involved, I thought, inthe Board's accepting the lagged way in the first place. I amimpressed by Henry's argument. I do think the speed of adjustment issomething that is going to plague us because I personally believe thatsooner or later, but perhaps not right now, Willis, we're either goingto get a big surge or we're going to get a big collapse in theaggregates and then we are not going to be able to do anything about-13-2/4-5/80it because of the lags with which the demand schedule can be affected.And two weeks is a meaningful amount of time in shortening thatprocess, if indeed it does shorten the process. I don't know that itnecessarily would because, after all, the Desk knows that the moneysupply has surged or has fallen out of bed before the reserves have tobe put up to support the higher amount or the lower amount; andpresumably if they don't follow a strictly mechanical formula, theycan begin to make adjustments for it early on in their strategy. Soeven that can be overcome.My biggest problem is that I would lean towardcontemporaneous accounting except that I think the structure is muchtoo complicated to use it. Reported deposits are extremelycomplicated; there is quite a variety of deposits with different kindsof reserves against them. And it seems to me all of that is much moredifficult [to manage] on a contemporaneous basis; it would not be adisadvantage otherwise if we had a very simple structure. Now, italso happens that the membership bills all propose a very much simplerstructure of reserves than we now have. And it seems to me that if[the structure were simpler], that would also tend in some sense, Bob,to do away with the bank relations problem because it is no longer anoptional matter as to whether to follow the specified procedures. Itseems to me that a very much simpler structure and the change in thewhole reserve apparatus that would be associated with a new bill,which probably wouldn't take effect for six months or something likethat, might be a time for introducing a change. But I would tie it tothose kinds of developments; I wouldn't do it now.By the way, I do believe the point made by Frank and othershas some value: With our current way of processing the daily reportof deposits and the programming that exists we probably don't have thecapacity to make the change without risking a collapse of thestructure. That has begun to bother me. So, I wouldn't do anythingnow; but the introduction of a new simplified system on differentterms and conditions might be an occasion for going to it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Timlen.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, I have heard at least sixeconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York opine on the matterof reverting to contemporaneous reserves. Not one of them thinksthere is any major advantage in such a change, so I will be disposedto follow that professional judgment in my Bank. I must say that JohnBalles has given most of my points in terms of the bank relations[effects of] such a change and I would like to stress the importanceof that. It is lead time, not only at the Reserve Banks but at thecommercial banks as well. I would say, too, that I don't think thatFirst VPs are in a position to start changing their priorities in thecomputer support area. We have a number of very key projects goingforward in that area to bring up our new FRCS 80 communicationsnetwork. We are entering the area of resource sharing. And to changeour priorities to accommodate something that is not held out as havinga major advantage is to me very poor planning. I would also say thatwe have had so many changes in the area of reserves--and those changesinvolve a cost to our member banks--that this would just add to thedifficulties of shaping things in an orderly way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Rice.2/4-5/80-14-

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I also tread tentatively in an arealike this. In general, I am persuaded by Mr. Axilrod's theoreticalarguments that contemporaneous reserve accounting has advantages inthe short run when applied to a reserve targeting approach to monetarycontrol. Mostly though, I am impressed by what Mr. Sternlight and Mr.Holmes had to say, which is that it probably won't make a great dealof difference in how the Desk operates. I just have one question thatI'd like to ask Mr. Axilrod, if I may. I assume you are familiar withIrving Auerbach's arguments in favor of lagged reserve accounting. Itake it that this is essentially an argument that the effects of anyshifts in money demand won't be very quickly felt in markets and thatthe argument is based on the actual behavior of commercial banks intheir lending and in their portfolio management. I wonder what youwould say in response to Mr. Auerbach.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, Governor Rice, Irv has a much morecomplicated mind, I think, than I do. Also, the evidence with regardto bank response has been developed over a number of years when theSystem has been running a different kind of policy that is veryaccommodative to bank needs. If at today's interest rates the bankneeded reserves, the System supplied it. So every banker worth hissalt knew that he could rely on the federal funds market within plusor minus 1/4 percentage point to make his adjustments. In that kindof environment, adjustments do tend to be made quite slowly. That maybe the best kind of environment; I am not questioning that. But Ithink that's the basis for the empirical evidence. Without laggedreserve accounting you introduce the possibility of controlling totalreserves. Now, you may or may not want to control them literally, butyou introduce that possibility whereas with lagged reserve accountingthat's much more difficult to do. If you can control total reserves,offsetting borrowing as it occurs, then it follows that the banks aresimply not going to be able to put out the deposits and that inconsequence interest rates are going to move sharply up or sharplydown as banks are forced to make those adjustments. If the Committeewants to move toward the kind of world where it is more certain ofcontrolling total reserves in the short run, or indeed in the longrun, then I think abandonment of lagged reserve accounting would makeit more practicable to do so. Now, if bank adjustments take a longtime, then it might require a lot more interest rate variation in theshort run to overcome that kind of inertia. However, I would feelreasonably confident that after some transition period the process ofbank adjustments would be much shorter. Of course, in that processbanks would begin holding more excess reserves so we'd have thatproblem to worry about. I know this is somewhat general, but that'show I would respond to the kinds of comments that Irv makes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends in considerable part upon whatwe do with the discount window issue.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Yes. I am sure, even if we leave the windowopen and don't close it, total reserves leaves you the possibility ofchasing it. You may not ever catch it, but it leaves you thepossibility of chasing it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Coldwell.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. I have only two comments, Mr. Chairman.First, I would agree with the Account Manager that this is likely to2/4-5/80-15-have [only] minor advantages.But secondly, I would caution theCommittee that this is another interruption in the overall picture of[the policy] the Committee is trying to follow. If we add that on topof our redefined aggregates as well as possible daylight overdraftsand additions from the membership bill, we're likely to complicate thefigures [further] and they are going to be difficult for people tofollow, even our very good staff.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.President Willes.I can't contemplate that possibility.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I found Henry'scomments and Chuck's comments particularly useful.So I would like to[be recorded as agreeing with] whatever you wrote down for them. Iwould add one thought, which goes back to the comment that Bob Mayomade.I am not much for gimmicks, either. But if there's a bankrelations problem, as many think there is, it just might be possiblethat the kind of proposal Bill Poole made can be structured in such away that we don't give much away but present it to the banks as thoughwe are giving them something when we are taking away lagged reserves.His kind of penalty scheme, for example, in terms of the carryoverwould make it possible to say that we are going to take away laggedreserves but we are going to give banks some flexibility they don'thave now. And yet if we structure that penalty in the right way, infact, we're not going to give away much in terms of sloppiness in thereserve figures.Looked at in that way--unless, as Chuck says, we getthe whole thing solved with the bill--it might be useful to consider aIt may be agimmick like that simply as a bank relations vehicle.means to get the advantages and not have the negative bank relationsimpact that some of us, at least, are concerned about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I guess everybody has talked who wants totalk. Is there anybody else who urgently wants to talk? Mr. Kimbrel.When I put the adverb in front of it, you're in trouble!

[SECTION]

MR. KIMBREL. I have a personal bias toward contemporaneousreserves. And if we were operating so that we could accomplish it, Iwould certainly opt for that. But I suppose our real thrust [shouldbe] Desk efficiency in discharging our directives, and those at theDesk don't seem to be too enthusiastic about contemporaneous reserves.I accept that against the environment of the costs of programming sucha change at the Reserve Banks and commercial banks. And, Mr.Chairman, right at the moment any change in our relationships with ourmember banks, even this, is not exactly very well timed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, those cautions seem to be ratherunanimously felt. I must say the other side of it is--I don't knowhow important it is substantively--that when we work with a two-weeklag in the context of what we're trying to do now, one has a greatsense of artificiality. We are working to affect a reserve figurethat we always know we cannot affect because it always depends uponsomething that happened two weeks earlier. It leaves me at least witha very uncomfortable feeling over a period of time. But I think itI don'thas been useful to get all these considerations on the table.know whether we have to look carefully at the reverse lag situationand so forth or not.2/4-5/80-16-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, we can. It depends how promptly theBoard would want to take this up. But Mr. Lindsey has already doneconsiderable work in that area, so we would be in a position todevelop something.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You are in a position to talk prettyquickly about that. I don't know where we'll come out, but-MR. PARTEE. Paul, if we are going to be doing additionalstudies on this, I have always been very taken by the notion of doingaway with Saturday and Sunday, which is another gimmick.

MR. PARTEE. Yes, excuse me, for Federal Reserve purposesonly, because of all the inefficiency of flows back and forth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the relevance of that comment isthat one thing leads to another. And there is this question ofwhether to make a whole bunch of changes at one time or to keep makingchanges, as I think we have been doing, that upset people.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. A memo on that very subject, on the effect of amove from 7 to 5 days, has been prepared for the Board. We didn'twant to send it forward right at this time because of the confusionwith the memo prepared for this meeting, but we do have a staffrecommendation on that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. At the very least, obviously, there are alot of arguments to delay for a while. I think we ought to get allthese things on the table; maybe we won't want to delay them all. Wecan look at the membership issue in a month or two and see where thatstands, but we ought to have at least a preliminary feeling of how wewould want to go, depending upon the resolution of that issue. Let'shope it gets resolved one way or the other.Well, I don't think thereis anything more to add on this unless the Desk people want to sayanything in conclusion. Well, it has been useful [to see] how uniformmany of the views are about the theoretical desirability and thepractical difficulties in this.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to add onefootnote to this. From my perspective, it is not merely theoreticaldesirability and practical difficulty but, as you commented, theartificiality of playing with these numbers. That is driven home tome almost every week, so I feel some practical impact of that.

At the same time, we have $2.6 billion worth of swapdebt remaining and I am going to have to ask for a second renewal on agood chunk of that swap debt. And the U.S. Treasury has a verysubstantial short position in that it used a lot of the resources ofSo, we have athe earlier Carter notes in the intervention last fall.We have to balance off our wish to seerather great need for marks.the dollar rise a little to reinstill a bit of confidence in the

And this rediversification-there's no term for it and the politics only goes one way--this flow-18-2/4-5/80of funds back into the dollar provides us with opportunities. TheBundesbank had one offer put to them this morning on which it decidedit didn't like the exchange rate. We would see quite a bit of that aswell: People coming back to the dollar, selling large chunks of markson the exchange market, and either the Bundesbank or ourselves takingthose [marks] off the market.

[SECTION]

MR. BAUGHMAN. Our decision as to whether to use any marks weacquire for the purpose of repaying debt will hinge not on the factthat we've got some marks but rather on what is happening in theexchange rates?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. Well, there is a certain urgency as far as ourrepayment of debt is concerned. And whenever the dollar is strongenough to take it, we open doors and windows. We have not gone intothe exchange market as an open buyer of marks. That's one point I wasmaking in my [report]. But to the extent that someone comes along andoffers marks to us, we will take them and use them to repay debt.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE. Oh, no, I am not trying to go in that direction,as far as the policy is concerned. But in terms of my ownresponsibilities I feel that I have an urgency to clear this up. Now,there is a tradeoff--we have to choose--because we're covering thisdebt at a rather substantial loss to the Federal Reserve. And if wewaited three months or six months, the exchange value of the dollarmight be such that we could repay at a profit.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Could you expand a little on what you perceiveas market expectations about future inflation? I see that Treasurybill futures, for instance, have changed by a very substantial amount,something close to 100 basis points over a month or so.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. I hadn't focused on a particular quantity,Governor Wallich. It's just that "expectations of inflation" seems tobe the most commonly cited factor for this very marked rise in thelonger end of the market, with the longer bonds up about 100 basispoints over the past month. And there is the budget message; eventhough it perhaps more frankly acknowledged inflation than some pastAdministration messages, there is still the feeling that if theAdministration is saying it's that bad, it's going to be even worse.I guess this is the kind of thing that greets one at times like this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You mentioned that some people thought thenew money supply figures would look higher. Why should they have thatidea?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. I suppose just fear of the unknown, really.We're coming out with something new, and it's partly that. It'spartly perhaps a misconception that since these new series are likelyto include some elements that have been growing rapidly the aggregateswill tend to show more rapid growth. That's the feeling. If there issome account taken of the checkable deposits and money market funds-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The reason I asked is that they don't haveany sense of this revised seasonal.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. No, but they have expressed skepticism aboutthe recent seasonal. Certainly I have heard the comment that the slowgrowth in the past few months may have partly reflected an inadequateseasonal adjustment for that period.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. Peter along those same lines, all the newdefinitions in January would show greater growth rates than we had forthose same measures in September to December whereas all the old onesshow less in January. What is the market going to say to that? Thisis very closely related to what you were saying.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a press conference scheduled forThursday, I think, to attempt to explain these new figures, and thatquestion is sure to arise. I don't look forward with a great sense ofanticipation to trying to explain either the substantial actualcomplications or the fact that the numbers look higher.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We got through our agenda down to item 4anyway, yesterday. I suggest that we begin with the staff report onthe economic situation and then perhaps take a little more time, if wewant to, on the discussion of the economic situation and implicationsfor the longer-term ranges in the light of the fact that this is themeeting at which we have to set them for a year ahead. Mr. Altmanntells me he would appreciate, for purposes of writing the minutesanyway, a fuller discussion of your views than we have had at somerecent meetings. But more important substantively is the fact thatthis is the annual meeting where we have to consider and rationalizewhat we do in terms of the longer-range outlook. In that connection,I don't know whether all of you noticed that the President exercisedhis prerogative to relocate, I guess is the right word, the HumphreyHawkins objectives. In the original Act they were 4 percentunemployment and a 3 percent rate of price increase in 1983, and hemoved back the unemployment objective 2 or 3 years and the priceobjective--what, 5 years?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I think it's 1986 [for the unemploymentobjective] and 1988 [for the price objective].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it was 3 years and 5 years. It isthe first time that particular prerogative has been exercised, andreconciles what we do with the dictates of that Act. I mentioned lasttime that it might be useful--I will not insist upon this--to quantifyyour feelings about the outlook. I'd say the best way to do it interms of the real GNP would be on a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarterbasis. In terms of prices, the consumer price index is the easiestone to think about. And I suppose the unemployment rate would be thetraditional one. If you want to give some sense of your figures, youcan do it with any appropriate qualification that you think isThat you feel reasonably confident about it or immenselydesirable:uncertain about it or anything in between, because I think that ispart of the flavor within which we must operate. [We need] to takeaccount of the uncertainties in setting our own policy. Given wherewe're starting, I hope to have a great revolution and perhaps have thecoffee break a little earlier, more toward the breakfast hour thantoward lunch, after we finish the discussion of the economic outlook.With that, you may begin, Mr. Kichline.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm a little confused by this last chart.This shows a rising rate of inflation through most of the first halfof 1981, or the first quarter anyway. I thought your projectionearlier showed a declining rate of price increase over that period.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. Well, this is the GNP implicit deflator; on afixed weight basis it goes down. As you know, the GNP implicitdeflator subtracts out the energy prices coming from abroad and, infact, gives us a lower number than is being experienced domestically.So the implicit deflator at this time would be an understatement ofthe impact of inflation in this early 1980 period. The fixed weightdeflator is around 10 percent.-23-2/4-5/80I

MR. KICHLINE. We use the errors from the quarterly model inthe equations, which are determined from past history. We run a largenumber of simulations; in fact this is based upon 400 experiments withthe model. And when looking at that, we determine it with a 70percent confidence interval.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. Could I ask a question, Mr. Chairman? TheChairman [of the Congressional Committee] has asked us to talk aboutpossibilities regarding real GNP, the CPI, and unemployment. As Iunderstand your presentation, your real GNP forecast for 1980 would bedown 2.2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. Well, we have a forecast of around 15-1/2percent in the first quarter of this year with a combination of energy[prices] and high mortgage rates driving it up. It drops to 11-3/4percent [in the second quarter] and then to 9-1/4 percent in thesecond half of this year, which measured fourth quarter-to-fourthquarter gives you around 11-1/2 percent.

MR. KICHLINE. Well, I don't have a consensus.I can giveyou some numbers based on a couple of the econometric model forecasts.I might just say that a great deal of difficulty is associated withthis sort of exercise in that both the monetary and fiscal assumptionsdiffer. And in many cases one doesn't know what the energy priceassumptions are. Most outside forecasters that I am aware of nowinclude in their control projections some sort of tax cut as well as aconsiderably more expansive monetary policy if specified, or if notspecified, implicitly so. Most of them have a recession, I would say,that is two or three quarters in length beginning now. They havemaintenance of very high prices and a much sharper recovery inThe Wharton model is somethingactivity late this year or in 1981.And they assumelike that, for example, and they do have a tax cut.M1 growth of 6-1/2 percent compared to our 5 percent.

All of that is achieved with a4-1/2 percent M1 growth, which is magic compared to anything in thepostwar period.

MR. KICHLINE. The level in the fourth quarter of 1980 is 9.6percent on the 3-month bill rate; in the fourth quarter of 1981, it's8.8 percent. The staff forecast has a bill rate of 11 percent in Q41980 and 11-1/2 percent in Q4 1981. There is no explicit moneyassumption that goes with the Administration's forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. Well, as I say, in part the deflator is astatistical artifact when import prices are rising very rapidly. I dobelieve that there's little that can be done to change the course ofprice developments within the next three or four months.In fact,already just about half of the first quarter is over, so in our viewwe're locked into a very adverse price performance in the first halfof this year.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. Do you see that prevailing through the secondquarter of 1981?In other words, you don't see any relief even thoughwe're doing what we are doing here in gradually reducing the rate of[monetary growth]?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. As I say, part of that is attributable to theperformance of import prices in influencing this calculation.It isour view that prices do improve.If you take a look at an alternativemeasure of prices, in the section that Jerry Zeisel was referring to-go back one section [in the handout] right before the yellow sheet-there is a chart that plots the gross domestic business product, whichis a fixed weight price index. There some of the problems fromshifting weights are at least taken out, and you can see that we dohave a decline beginning in the second half of this year, stretchinginto and throughout 1981.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. But if we hang in there, which we are determinedto do, and keep firm control over and gradually reduce the growth rateof whatever Ms we are controlling, don't all these other things fallinto line? Or do you still have to run 400 equations to see what--?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. What falls into line?I only wanted to tellyou that while we give you point forecasts, we're quite aware thatthere's a wide range of error associated with any forecast. We triedto look at past history to suggest how big that range is, and it'ssizable. We have no difficulty with your point that monetary policyover time does have an influence on the economy and on prices. Infact, the answer is:Yes, we agree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Willes.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Like Governor Schultz,I found this a particularly interesting presentation, but I think fora slightly different reason.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.You mean you're not simple-minded?

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. Without touching that line with a 10-foot pole,I want simply to refer to the very last chart! I think the staff hasdone us a great service in presenting that because with all theconversation about whether the increase in the CPI is going to be 9.2percent or whatever, if you look at that band [depicting the range oferror], that's an incredibly large band. We talk about the CPI in thefourth quarter and it could be plus or minus some very large numbers.While it's useful to go through these exercises to see where we comeout, I think we really don't pay as much attention as we should to theenormous uncertainty that attaches to these forecasts. We've had somepeople doing some work at our place--and I don't understand thetechnical details so I won't take you through it--but let me just giveyou an example of the kinds of problems one runs into in making2/4-5/80-28-quantitative forecasts. If you think of watching a wagon on a TVscreen or a movie screen, you'll notice that the wagon is goingforward and it looks like the wheels are going backwards. The reasonfor that, of course, is that as the wheel goes forward in the firstframe the spoke is up in the center and then it goes forward and it'sthe second frame before it gets all the way back up to the top againand so on around. So, even though the wheel is moving forward, whenyou take pictures, it looks as if it's moving backwards.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.It depends on the speed of the projector.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. You're exactly right. It depends on the speedof the projector and the speed with which the wheel is moving. Now,let's suppose that decisions are made in continuous time and you takeeconometric snapshots on a monthly or quarterly basis. It could be amatter of pot luck that the speed of the decisionmaking framework andthe speed of the projector are the same. If they're not, you canactually take a picture that gives you just the opposite view ofwhat's going on. We happen to think that in many cases that's exactlywhat happens. We have all these nice pictures that are actuallygiving us pictures exactly the opposite, in terms of policyimplications, of what is going on in the "real world" and how it'sfunctioning. I simply say that to indicate that I think we need to beparticularly [cautious] at this time, given not only the uncertaintiesin the world but the uncertainties about the tools that we're workingwith, about what we think we can even say in terms of the time pathfor the economy over the next eight quarters.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have expressed yourself eloquently onthe wide band of uncertainty. Would you care to express a view on thecentral tendency as you see it? Or are you so uncertain that you haveno view on this policy?

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. If you press me to the wall, I will. I don'tthink I can say anything with any credibility, but I'll give younumbers anyway. And if the numbers turn out to be-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think it is not unimportant thatyou say there's a great degree of uncertainty and I would like to getthat-MR. WILLES. With that great big long caveat that I just gaveyou, the numbers that we have in terms of real GNP for 1980 are morepositive than the staff's. We think on balance that there's going tobe some very modest positive real growth during 1980 and we tie thatin with what we see happening with fiscal policy and slightly strongerbusiness investment. I don't quarrel at all with the staff's deflatornumber or their CPI number. If anything, though, given what I justsaid about defense spending and so on, those numbers might turn out tobe low rather than high. I also don't quarrel with their unemploymentnumbers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Okay, that's a clear view!Mr. Timlen.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. The one number I can read accurately from thiswhole list of numbers is our projection of unemployment in the fourthquarter of 1980, which is 7.3 percent.In New York we're probablygiving more weight to defense spending than the Board staff is giving,not only in terms of defense spending by the Federal government butcapital expenditures by the private sector in anticipation ofgovernment orders.In terms of real GNP, then, our picture for theyear, quarter by quarter, differs slightly in the timing and the depthof the possible recession. Our four quarters run a positive 1 percentfor the first quarter, a positive 0.5 percent in the second quarter,then two negative numbers in the third and fourth quarters of minus 1and minus 2 percent. On a full year average basis that comes out to[minus] 0.6 percent.Our deflator quarter by quarter ranges between8.5 and 8.9 percent, so for the year we have 8.5 to 9 percentinflation [as measured] by the deflator. Our CPI is somewhere around10-1/2 to 11 percent.One thing that I would throw out that you havenot asked for is that our people in New York think the saving ratewill continue to be quite low for the entire year of 1980; to wit,they have it averaging out at 2.9 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.4-1/2 percent.What are you assuming on the saving rate?It drifts up and for the year 1980 averages

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. Yes, there's a big difference between the Boardstaff forecast and ours on the saving rate. On the federal fiscalsituation, for fiscal 1980 we are looking at a deficit close to $45billion; I'd say $40 to $45 billion. And for fiscal 1981, dependingupon a tax cut, we have $40 billion on the low side without a tax cutand $60 billion on the high side with a tax cut. I don't really havea good judgment on whether there will be a tax cut on not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Do you think there should be one?

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.Do I think there should be one?For a change, Iwould agree with Mark Willes.But some of the numbers are hard for meto estimate in terms of the full impact of defense spending, whetherout of the government or the private sector. In terms of the-30-2/4-5/80consumer, I just don't know how to read currently the effect of themild winter. I would have been rather concerned about the cost ofheating but I know our Buffalo branch is running considerably belowbudget in terms of heating that building. What the experience is inprivate homes, I just don't know. So the consumer may have a littleuptick there.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.Why don't you stand up, Phil?

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. No, I am not going to chance that! I agreethat there's a high degree of uncertainty, but our track record andour past performance clearly indicate that we've underestimated therate of inflation and I expect we will continue to do so. I thinkthere's going to be a rapid defense build-up, but impacting largelyupon expectations in the first part of this year. If that is thecase, we may see a moderation from what the staff was [projecting] inthe rate of decline in the first half. I think fiscal policy is goingto be easier than portrayed by the Administration's budget. Fiscalpolicy is likely to be stimulative instead of restraining and Isuspect we will probably underestimate the aggregate data that we areusing. As for the data you've requested we comment on, Mr. Chairman,I would put real GNP in a zero to plus 1/2 percent mode, the CPI atthe end of the year in the neighborhood of 14 percent, and theunemployment rate at about 7 percent. And I have already indicatedthat I think fiscal policy is going to be easier.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.So you're not in favor of a tax cut, Itake it.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. I am certainly not in favor of a personalincome tax cut. I think there is a case to be made to improve therate of business capital stimulation in the area of improving jobexpectations, but I would question whether this is the right time todo that. There's a fundamental fact of high inflation, which we needto continue to keep our eye on; unless that is damped, thepossibilities of a rising rate of inflation are very good. I justdon't find myself in agreement with the idea of gradualism in economicpolicy. It's a lovely theory but a practical monstrosity. Creditavailability in the economy is high in my view right now. And withexpectations of high inflation, the interest rate restraint isminimal.

MR. SMOOT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had very little timeto prepare for this. Dave is not well and sends his best, however, toall of you. The last time I was down here I did have time to preparea great deal and I was very confused. Now I haven't had much time toprepare very well and I am still very confused! Nevertheless, wewould be somewhat less pessimistic than the Board staff's projections.To address your questions:On the real GNP, we see it negative forthe year, but maybe in the range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent negative. Onthe CPI, we'd say up 10 to 11 percent for the year, but if I read myown charts correctly we'd be closer to 10 percent in the fourthquarter. And on unemployment, consistent with our somewhat moreoptimistic view on the economy, we would be in the range of 7 to 7-1/2percent. On the tax cut, we have considered a tax cut in the secondhalf of the year in the range of $25 to $30 billion. I would agreewith Governor Coldwell that it ought to be carefully constructed tostimulate capital formation and to look at the social security tax.Other than that, I don't find our differences with the Board staff tobe that great.

MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The staff's forecastis a bit more pessimistic than our forecast, and that largely centersOne is the saving rate, which the Board staff'son two differences.forecast suggests will increase over the coming year while we believeit will be either flat or at least at a low level, thus givingconsumers the ability to maintain in part their standard of livingeven in view of heavy inflation. Secondly, we believe defensespending will be somewhat greater than the staff is forecasting forthe year 1980 coming into the third and fourth quarters; it may be $2to $3 billion larger in each of those quarters than the staff hasprojected, thus giving stimulus to the economy. As a result, we wouldsee the real GNP at about flat, zero to maybe one percent on thepositive side, with unemployment someplace between 7 and 7-1/2percent. The CPI in our judgment, however, is going to continue at afairly rapid rate. Our judgment is that it will still be in the 11 to12 percent range in the fourth quarter. As to the fiscal side,obviously there will be much more expansion than the staff or theAdministration are forecasting. And as to a tax cut, I would agreewith whoever said it would be a tragedy.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Partee.-32-2/4-5/80

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, I have been concerned about defensespending as a question mark in the outlook. I must say that the chartthe staff has provided us, showing an alternative with $10 billionmore defense spending this year and $20 billion more in 1981 and in1982 on top of the 6 percent real growth that's already in there fornonpersonnel costs, strikes me as a good liberal estimate of the extradefense spending that might occur or that is possible in the shortrun. And I would point out to you that it doesn't change the numbersall that much. I believe they did this with the model, so it includesorders effects and that kind of thing--that is, effects that occurbefore the actual defense spending. So, both that and the fact thatit seems to me to look a little less [tenuous] than it was a month agomake me feel that it isn't such a big possible plus in the economy inthe immediate future as it might have been. Also, the saving rate isjust very difficult [to forecast]. New York has a continuation of avery low saving rate throughout 1980 and one could argue that therehas been a permanent shift in the saving rate. I don't think so. Ithink it's going to come back up. I agree with the staff on that.There is no evidence of a permanent move from money to goods of thekind that would be indicated by that. So, I come down to anexpectation that real GNP will fall some this year, though probablyless than the staff has [in its forecast]--maybe 1 to 2 percent. Theemployment rate I am quite sure will rise significantly because I justdon't think it is possible that services and trade will continue toadd to the employment rolls without output, without a commensuratevalue added, much longer. So a 7-1/2 percent fourth-quarterunemployment rate is probably a reasonable forecast. I'd haveinflation a little higher than the staff has--at 9 to 10 percent, say,for the deflator and 10 to 12 percent for the CPI in the year ahead.As for fiscal policy, I think there will be a tax cut but probably notuntil next year. That's not as early as the alternative staffprojection has it, which is the middle of this year. It probably willoccur in early 1981, sometime in the spring, and it will improve 1981results a little from what the staff has projected. But I would pointout to you that I think an absolutely binding assumption on therecovery of the economy is the monetary assumption which, of course,we have the ability to control. Did I get everything on this [list]?

MR. PARTEE. No, I think we ought to wait. I think it willbe necessitated by a high and rising unemployment rate, and I figurethat will be obvious to everybody by early next year. So it's a nextyear venture rather than this year. When it occurs I agree with thecomments that have been made that we ought to do what we can to makeit stimulative for business investment if we have any effect. But Ido have to tell you that I think the full push will be to make it aconsumer tax cut when it occurs.

MS. TEETERS. Well, I would like to go back to the last chartagain, as Mark did. You notice those tolerance lines, the top and thebottom, are fairly narrow over the next three quarters. So it seemsto me that we're looking basically at a fairly set outlook for thenext three quarters and possibly into the fourth quarter, and I don't2/4-5/80-33-want to throw away what is one of our major advantages. The HumphreyHawkins Act requires us to give our outlook for this year. We have afairly good idea where we're going this year and where we're going toend up, and our views do not differ a great deal as I hear what hasIt's plus or minus a little here orbeen said around the [table].there, and that certainly falls within the tolerance limits of whatthe staff has projected. Secondly, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act says thatin the middle of the year we are to reassess what we are doing. Tolock ourselves into a policy at this point from now until 1981 is thebiggest mistake we could ever make. We have some idea where we aregoing for the next two quarters or we can come pretty close to it.Wehave a chance to reassess it in the middle of the year. And Icertainly don't want to vote for a policy at this time that is goingto result in T-bill rates of 11.7 or 12.2 percent in 1981.I wouldn'tquarrel a great deal with what the staff has projected. I would agreewithin one percentage point on almost any figure they gave us, thoughI'd probably expect a little higher unemployment rate than they'reprojecting and a little higher inflation rate, again depending on whathappens primarily in defense. But if you look at the full employmentsurplus in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1981, it jumps$30 billion. And it jumps another $20 billion between the first andfourth quarters of next year. We don't have to make a decision on[1981] at this point. We have two more major decision points betweennow and the beginning of next year, and I think we should utilize themto the fullest.[We need to] consider the fact that we may settle ona 4-1/2, 5, or 5-1/2 percent rate of money growth and it's not goingto have a great deal of influence over the next nine months. However,at midyear if we have unemployment rates of 7-1/2 or 8-1/2 percent, wemust be prepared to change our policy at that point.I don't want togo down the line item by item because I don't have a great quarrelwith [the forecast], but I do urge that we not give up theflexibility.

MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I would like first to turn to page3 of this package of charts and ask a question to the staff and thenmake a comment. On the calculation of the high employment budget youshow for 1980 and 1981, Jim:These are your calculations, I assume,rather than the official figures set forth by the Administration?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. They're our calculations but we use the sameprocedure, which has been revised.

MR. BALLES.In other words, it's benchmarked at a 5.1percent unemployment rate?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.Correct.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.All right, thank you. My comment is this:Within the last couple of years our Research Department has done quitea bit of work [on this subject].In fact, we circulated a paper tothe rest of you, just to share this view, giving an alternativenoninflationary full employment rate, which we estimate to besomewhere between the high 5 percent [to] low 6 percent area, maybecentered on 6 percent. That's based on a lot of detail I won't gointo, but it [involves] all the factors going into the changes in thecomposition and behavior of the labor force.I asked our staff to-34-2/4-5/80make a computation of what the high employment surplus would be if oneassumed a 6 percent unemployment rate, and it produces some radicallydifferent figures. For 1980 the high employment budget surplus, [ascalculated] officially by the Administration, is said to be $4billion. But using the 6 percent unemployment rate figure, we come upwith a deficit of $20 billion. Furthermore, off-budget financing,which as I understand it is not included in this high employmentbudget surplus calculation, would add another $17 billion. So lookingat it in this alternative way, I can see the possibility of fiscalstimulus to the tune of $37 billion even on a so-called highemployment basis, defined as 6 percent in this calendar year. Andthat, by the same reasoning, translates into a surplus of $12 billionThe reason I went through this exercise was to get ain 1981.different view, depending on one's assumptions, of whether we havereal fiscal stimulus or fiscal restraint or how fast we are movingfrom one to the other. It nets out for this year, certainly in myview, to a pretty sizable fiscal stimulus rather than the restraintofficially forecast. And I think that has a pretty broad bearing onappropriate monetary policy.

MR. PARTEE.You have an improvement, John?

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Yes. In my calculation, it changes from a $37billion stimulus on the high employment basis, which adds in offbudget financing of $17 billion and assumes a 6 percentnoninflationary full employment rate in fiscal 1980, to a $12 billionsurplus in fiscal 1981. Now that is quite a movement. But it startslate this calendar year and [continues] into 1981.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, the Greenbook revision resulted ina move from a V-shaped decline to a sort of saucer-shaped recession,which is probably in the right direction. Despite this, I think theunderlying foundations of the economy are quite weak. What strengthwe have had recently has come mainly from efforts on the part ofhouseholds and some others to beat inflation. Now, I am aware of theargument that the rising wealth of households stemming from suchthings as appreciation of the value of housing may produce a wealtheffect that will cause them to hold their expenditures at higherlevels. But I think that is really a pretty weak reed on which tohang the forecast. Sooner or later, this artificial prop to spendingthat stems from inflation is going to fall apart, and an inflationaryeconomy is not a healthy one. And if it does fall apart, then at thattime I would expect, if inflation is worse, that we would have agreater decline because of the attrition of real income and the highinterest rates that would discourage business investment. Also, Ithink we would have a clamor for wage and price controls. If, on theother hand, inflation is showing signs of abatement, then the effectsof this decline are going to be diminished. So I think Chuck'sobservation a while ago that a lot depends on what we do is a verysignificant point. That will affect the outcome to a great degree.And I think we're going to have a very difficult job in the monthsahead because, like John Balles, I feel we're going to have morestimulus from the fiscal side than most people seem to be assuming.But I do think we are dead serious about our stated intention to bringdown the rate of growth in the aggregates, and I think we'll standfirm. But since I won't be voting next year, I have a little lessconfidence in that than I otherwise would have.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.You want to say that again?

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. To get down to the figures, I think the drop inGNP might be nearer 3 percent than the 2 percent the staff hasprojected. Since I expect us to do well in the policy area, I wouldput the fourth-quarter rate in the consumer price index a bit lower,at 9 percent. I would guess their unemployment rate is not very faroff; my guess would tend toward 8 percent. As I indicated, I thinkthe deficit is understated--the stimulative effects are understated-and I certainly would not favor a tax cut at this juncture.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Kimbrel.

[SECTION]

MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, our views are not significantlydifferent from those enunciated by the staff. To put numbers to them:For real GNP, we're looking at a minus 2 percent; for the unemploymentrate, we're in the neighborhood of 8 percent; and for the CPI, 11percent. We do feel, though, that the fiscal [package] may beconsiderably easier than the staff is now reflecting. We certainlywould not support a tax cut unless it were directed toward capitalinvestment. We wonder if defense spending may not be somewhat larger,Finally,particularly in the private sector anticipating [orders].Mr. Chairman, we are growing somewhat concerned--and our concern wasnot lessened any by Mr. Sternlight's comments yesterday afternoon-that the market increasingly is believing that we are not slowingmoney growth to the extent it expected from our October decision.[Given] that and our track record in this upcoming period of the yearwhen with tax refunds we've been somewhat less than successful inanticipating what money growth would be--if indeed we miss that as-37-2/4-5/80much this year and we do have excessive money growth--I have tobelieve that inflationary expectations are going to be escalatingagain and may contribute more trouble than we need.

MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, a question [to the staff] first.Insofar as there may be a windfall profits tax, are you assuming thatthe revenues raised thereby will be placed back into the economy or isthat pretty much outside the projections here?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE. No, it's included in the projections. Thewindfall profits tax--technically I think the words associated with itare "energy trust fund," but that's a misnomer if one believes thatthe revenues are segregated--is included in the budget figures. For1980 we have something like a net addition of nearly $5 billion torevenues.It's something like $7-1/4 to $7-1/2 billion in revenuesand $2-1/2 billion in expenditures, so it's around $5 billion netreceipts. And for 1981 it's around $10 billion net receipts.So,that is included in these figures.

[SECTION]

MR. BAUGHMAN. Thank you. I don't have a view significantlydifferent from the staff.I think the degree of uncertainty in theoutlook is not unusual at this point in time; it's probably less nowthan it was a couple of months ago.It seems to me that the cork isout of the defense expenditure bottle now and that that will probablygo along about as fast as orders can be placed and procurement can bestepped up. That leads me to think that insofar as we may deviatefrom the staff projection it is likely to be in the direction of astronger economy, less progress on the inflation front, and probably alittle less build-up in unemployment. But for our purposes here, I amperfectly satisfied to accept the staff projections. If I were toshade away from them, it would be in the direction I have indicated.In addition to the defense spending, I have a view similar to the NewYork Bank's view that consumers are still in the process of adjustingto inflation and that the saving rate is likely to stay very low untilthey do see some improvement on the inflation side.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. I base my projections almost entirely on a rate ofbasic money growth, and the figures I will suggest are predicated on arate of growth of M-1A and M-1B of roughly 5 percent. If there is a 5percent basic money growth rate, I would see real GNP declining bysee the GNP deflator, which is what we look at really, at about a 102/4-5/80-38-percent rate during the fourth quarter of next year, or maybe 9-1/2percent--obviously, these percentages can vary by 1/2 point--and Iwould see an unemployment rate of roughly 7 percent. However, I feelvery strongly that what we do will have a very direct bearing on theoutcome of these figures, and if we were to set growth ranges for M-1Aand M-1B at 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and if growth came in at close to3-1/2 percent, that would have a significant weakening effect on thesethree figures that I suggested, as we see it.In other words, GNPwould be significantly lower and unemployment significantly higher.And if growth came in close to the top end of that band, at let's say6-1/2 percent, I think we'd see a much more serious acceleration inthe deflator, a significantly stronger GNP result, and a significantlylower unemployment rate. What I am driving at is that I think we havethe key to this in our hands and that all three of these factors willdepend on what we decide to do and how carefully and with whatdetermination we stick with whatever we decide to do.I wouldpersonally be very much opposed to a tax cut.I would perhaps be muchmore tolerant of a tax cut that was an across-the-board, consumerdirected tax cut if later in the year or next year the governmentformation.I think that might be desirable but I do not favor a taxcut, not that it makes much difference in that regard what I think.But in what we do, we can make a big difference on the money growth.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN. I think it's great that we get these scenarios outon the table. My only concern is that my camera may be in sync but itSo the picture that comes out may be quitedistorted. But let's take several of these assumptions that we'veI must confess thatpassed over. First, the level of interest rates.when we talk about double digit interest rates, I get nervous. But Iremember that last year I got lectured by any number of people that ifwe passed the 10 percent rate, that was going to cut things off; and Iremember after October 6th how things just dried up completely. But Ithink we forget that it's real interest rates that people probablytake into consideration. And I have been amazed at the amount ofmoney coming out of the woodwork in the last two weeks of January andthe number of deals that are being formulated with respect toapartment houses, hotels, commercial buildings, and so forth. Theamount of money that is being committed in this area has stepped upI think we see it in the bond market,tremendously after this hiatus.Some of the current financing IJohn, in terms of their attitudes.think is being done to repay short-term debt. There's an awful lot oftalk going on with respect to financing, but that's not going to comeinto the investment picture until the last half of this year. Andthat being laced on top of defense expenditures, should they comealong, makes a little different scenario for this year's[performance].One other thing:In terms of your employment figures, haveyou put anything in there for a possible draft or increased militaryemployment?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Probably in 1981.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN. It's probably down the road; I don't say it isimmediate.But, again, as one [looks at] various scenarios with somedifferent inputs, there are different results, obviously. Whilehousing is down, I too am amazed at the amount of money that is evenshowing up for housing at the moment. So, as I look at the level ofrates, I go back to looking at availability; and I get nervous as towhat [level of] interest rates it will take to have a damping effecton some of these [sectors].In my scenario, I come out with a dip in the first half ofthis year because I think it's already under way. But I can see somerevival in the second half, so that I get a 1 percent decline for theyear but it's quite a different shape.The price [situation] reallyscares me. Go back and look at 1973 and 1974; maybe we're going tomultiply that distortion created by prices. And if the worldsituation changes, some of the pressure for relief could come nextyear--I think it's already under way for this year--and carry throughfor a while. But we may be [unintelligible] upswing continuingthrough part of 1981 and then real price distortion problems hittingus by the end of the year. I see price problems in the 15 percent[CPI] rate; that is going to give rise to increased wage demands andre-opening of contracts and all kinds of pressures and we don't knowhow that is going to factor through to the balance of the year. Andthat's not in your scenarios, in terms of the wage assumptions thatyou put in. One gets different price results with some of thesedifferent assumptions.So I am even more concerned about inflationdevelopments and what they mean not only for 1980 but perhaps for 1981and thereafter. And that has implications for the international sideand a whole host of things, which change the [scenario].I think thepressure for a tax cut is going to come both with the election problemand the first half year results. That will further complicate theproblem and I would be opposed to it. This would be in my scenario,Paul.

Mr. Chairman, we ought to be recorded asgenerally supporting the Board staff's projection and its numbers.However, unlike most of the others, if the forecast is in error, Ithink it will be because the recession could be substantially moresevere than they are projecting. We had a miss in our forecast in thelast half of 1979 because consumer behavior was much stronger than wewere forecasting on the basis of income growth and so on. This hasled New York and Kansas City and perhaps some of the rest of you tolook upon a 3 percent saving rate as a norm for the future. I thinkit is also possible that when the unemployment rate starts rising theconsumer will turn defensive and we will see the saving rate risehigher than the Board staff has projected and a bigger recession willresult. Also, the housing sector could be weaker than the staff hasprojected. We don't really yet have a good fix on how the currenthousing rate structure is impacting demand. But the Board staff hasthe weakest quarter at 1.4 million starts. It seems to me that wecould see at least one quarter substantially below that. So, I thinkwe have a risk of a much sharper recession in 1980 than the Boardstaff is projecting. It's a risk, but I can't attach theprobabilities to it.As far as defense spending is concerned, we've talked to themajor defense contractors in the Boston area like Raytheon and others,and they say that for the kind of hardware the Defense Department istalking about most of the money will be going into long lead timeitems. And while we may get a big effect on expectations in 1980,they don't see a big effect on employment until 1981, even if theprogram were to get geared up fairly soon. So, it seems to me that wecould see a different pattern: a very sharp recession followed by atax cut, an increase in the defense budget, and a big jump in 1981.That's another hypothesis that hasn't been stated around this table.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Wallich.We'll get every hypothesis on the table!

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. It seems to me that the odds have clearly movedin the direction of less recession and more inflation than they weresome time ago. I think the degree of uncertainty is very high becausethe saving rate is abnormal and, therefore, potentially unstable. Andif we move to higher rates of inflation, people could react veryunpredictably. But the thing that most impresses me about thebehavior of people is that in the last surge of inflation, in 1974,the saving rate went up--and it did so not only in this country butall over the world--while this time people have reacted differently.They pulled the saving rate down. That seems to be a message. Theyseem to be saying:"We're no longer so scared of losing our job thatwe're stopping our spending. We're now out to beat the game." Andthat suggests to me that we may be in a new ball game unless the moveto higher inflation rates throws a new scare into people.Well, I had anticipated a somewhat more severe recession thanthe staff, but recent events have taken me off that. I could see asmall dip in 1980 of maybe 1 percent, but [my forecast has] a verywide variance. I see inflation now at very high rates, with thedeflator at 12 percent for the year, that is year-to-year. And theCPI could be close to 15 percent. These [increases mean that] real-41-2/4-5/80interest rates are no longer positive. I know that some of us don'tbelieve that real interest rates mean very much. But we're only 19people and there are 220 million out there who believe differently orat least act as if they believe differently. So I share what PhilI don't see quantitative monetaryColdwell said on that score.restraint being in effect--that is, availability restraint. And Idon't think that these interest rates, particularly when one considersthem after taxes, really bite. So we have to consider now that we arein a group of high inflation countries with Italy and the UnitedKingdom. Then comes a tier of moderate inflation countries and thencome the low inflation countries. We've moved very far.That is whyI don't really expect a tax cut this year. I think these forces willgive people pause unless there is a significant deterioration in theclimate. Eventually, I think there will be a tax cut simply becausewe are getting more fiscal drag than we can accommodate over time. Icertainly would oppose a tax cut, and I would lean toward firmmonetary restraint. I don't know [how] one can have that confidencein the nominal aggregates that M-1A and M-1B convey. All we know isthat these [measures] are extremely uncertain. I don't think the newdefinitions capture all that's going on, especially in the Euromarket.We capture only a small part of that.So I believe money is reallyexpanding faster than we think, and I would want to take that intoaccount in thinking that we can have 15 percent inflation. Onunemployment, I have no difference with the staff; 7-1/2 percent bythe end of 1980 seems a possibility.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Mayo.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. First, to go back to the charts for just a minute:I greeted with some astonishment the chart on unit [labor] costindicators where output per hour, having deteriorated badly from thebeginning of 1976 to the present or the last available quarter,suddenly takes a new spurt of enthusiasm and becomes positive. Andyour unit labor cost, of course, shows just the opposite trend. Iwould like to believe this, but I am not sure what the staff has basedit on.

[SECTION]

MR. ZEISEL. Basically it is associated with our assumptionsor conclusions about more rational behavior by employers in regard totheir staffing. The deterioration in productivity is the other sideof the coin of this tremendous increase in employment relative to thelack of growth in output. We're anticipating that the pressures ofrising costs and the evident lack of strength in markets over the nextcouple of quarters will persuade employers that they are overstaffedand that, therefore, they will be laying off employees and trying tobring their costs better into line, which will show up in a somewhatimproved productivity performance. But as you will note, we havenegative productivity throughout 1980.It just isn't as bad as it wasin 1979.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.In effect, you're suggesting that whatever laborhoarding has taken place to date really isn't going to continue. Andthat's one of the reasons your unemployment rate is moving up as muchas it is.Is that correct?

[SECTION]

MR. ZEISEL.That is true, yes.2/4-5/80-42-

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. My other question on the charts relates to defensespending. Frank stole my headline on that by his mention of long leadtimes on defense contracts. I find the assumptions both in the budgetand in your table on real defense spending unreal. I don't think itis possible unless there is an awful lot of shelf items involved--morethan I can imagine--to add 6 percent to real defense spending in theremaining six months of the fiscal year. And that's all there is leftin this fiscal year. We have a history over the last 30 or 40 yearsof projecting increases in defense spending prematurely, and I thinkthis is happening again in the budget figures and in the staffforecast. Instead of being up 7 percent and up 8 percent or whateveris shown on this chart, I would say it's more likely to be up 2percent and up 12 percent. So, that would affect the attitude towardthese figures in 1980. On the other hand, I would support the totalthat you have in your staff forecast because I think it's more likelyto burst out on the nondefense side in light of other factors betweennow and the beginning of the new fiscal year. Now, that doesn't meanthere isn't an attitudinal and expectational response. But I think itstems mostly from the evaluation of the inflation and the real GNPoutlook a year ahead, rather than manifesting itself in defensespending in the fiscal year of 1980.Having said that, I won't repeat Mark's caveats, but in termsof point estimates I really don't have much quarrel with the staffforecast on real GNP. As for the probabilities, I would say theprobability is that there will be less growth--in other words a bigger[minus] 3 percent for the year. I am not quite as pessimistic asHenry, but I will take shelter under his umbrella on the price index.I don't think there is more than one chance in ten that we can getdown to 10 percent on either the CPI or the fixed weighted deflator bythe fourth quarter of this year. The chances are very good--I hate touse the word "good" that way--that it will still be above 10 percent.On unemployment, despite my question on the labor hoarding problem,the chances are unfortunately also very good that unemployment will beabove 8 percent because the inflation rate is so sticky and so builtinto consumer expectations that I think this is the way it's going tocrank out. No tax cut, please.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Rice.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, what I wanted to say was saidby Frank Morris. I have no reason to argue with the staff forecastwith respect to GNP, the unemployment rate, and the CPI. Given whatwe know today, these projections seem to me to be the most probableoutcome. But, I suppose like everybody else, I do have some worries;and one of them is the cumulative effect of the erosion of disposableincome on consumer expenditures. Consumers may well be prepared tospend less than has been projected in the forecast. And, of course,if that happens, there will be further consequences for the economy.Now, this may well be offset by the buildup in defense expenditurestoward the end of the year. So there is some uncertainty. But I doworry that the possible shortfall in consumer expenditures may wellmake the recession more severe than is projected. I also worry aboutthe cumulative effects of a restrictive monetary policy. If we aresuccessful in damping inflationary expectations, the reaction may wellbe stronger than we now see, and this may also operate to make therecession more severe. But these are just vague worries; I have no-43-2/4-5/80data to support them. And for the purpose of making suggestions as toAs formonetary policy, I am prepared to accept the staff's forecast.a tax cut, I would be opposed to a tax cut at the present time.However, depending on how things emerge in the future, a cancellationof the anticipated social security [tax increase] package could wellbe an appropriate measure. But that judgment would await futuredevelopments.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Schultz.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. Well, as everybody around here is aware, I havehad a high degree of uncertainty about what was going to happen. Ihave a little less right now, so far as my feelings about the nearterm are concerned. I see three areas of weakness. First, I thinkthe economy is a little weaker than the numbers will show in Januarybecause the weather in January was so remarkably good all over, and Ithink that had a considerable effect. I am seeing some areas ofrestraint that are secondary kinds of reactions to the October 6th[action].In the area of consumer credit, more and more banks arecutting back on the availability of consumer credit and are increasingthe price and other factors. We're also seeing that with [creditextended by] retail establishments; Sears and Penneys and others haverecently made those kinds of announcements. So, I think we are seeingsome restraint that hasn't been there before and the pressure isincreasing in that area. I do not think that we have seen the low inhousing. I agree with Frank Morris that it's going to go lower; itcould go considerably lower. We saw that chart on the commitmentrate, and my understanding is that the situation may be even worsethan that chart looks. And that's bound to begin to spill over intohousing durables pretty quickly. It hasn't done that much yet. Asfar as autos are concerned, I don't see anything that is going tobring them back very fast. Things may have to get worse in that area,partly as a result of the [tighter] consumer credit and partly becausegasoline prices are going to continue to go up. We see that there isPeople are more concernedmore conservation than we really thought.about [gasoline prices], and I think it's going to have a big effectSo, I don't look for any strengthon their purchases of automobiles.there in the near term.On the other hand, longer term I see some areas of strengththat may be stronger than the staff assumptions. I disagree with Boball of the news reports that say this involves sophisticated weaponsand there's a very long lead time. We are not looking at theoperations and maintenance side. My understanding is--I have justseen some recent figures--that the Pentagon is estimating that forammunition alone they need more than $20 billion. Now, ammunition issomething that can be produced pretty quickly. So I think we may seesome faster impact on the defense side. The other area is the taxI do not favor a tax cut this year; IIt is an election year.side.would, I think, next year. But we may get it this year. If you lookat the staff's chart "fiscal alternative-tax cut" and see what apolitician would see--that with a cut in payroll taxes he can have thebest of both worlds, better growth in GNP and lower inflation, whichis what that chart shows--that's very attractive to a politician.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I have missed one personal objectiveof speeding up the coffee hour appreciably. But since we're short of11 a.m., let me make a couple of observations. I do have the feelingin listening to some of the different economic forecasts and commentsthat our staff, which is sometimes accused of being Keynesian, feelsmore constrained by the money supply assumptions than more monetaristoriented people. And that accounts for some of the differences inview. Assuming that we're all intelligent people around the table,[given the] differences in outlook that have been recited, I don't seehow anyone can come to any opinion other than that there is a greatdeal of uncertainty in this forecasting business.In terms of what we have accomplished or have notaccomplished in monetary policy in recent months, particularly asreflected in expectations as best one can judge them, we have toconclude that we've been [set] back very substantially and havesuffered a grievous blow from everything that has been going oninternationally--whether you're talking about oil prices, or Iran, orAfghanistan and concern about defense spending. There's nothing muchwe can do about that, but I think in some sense we're back to squareone or worse in terms of the public's concern about inflation.So Itend to agree with those who see a risk of an inflationary breakout,in modified terms, on the up side as a real danger. I also agree withEmmett Rice and a couple of others who said that we could get a longerreaction in the economy on the down side if that happened. I don'tknow what we can do about that. We can't deal with both situations atthe same time. In fact, I don't think we can deal with the risk of adownturn and ignore the inflationary side, because they're part of thesame parcel in some sense.I feel rather strongly that it would be a great mistake toput much money on any particular forecast at this point. I come backto what Mark Willes said at the beginning, and I think the saving ratequestion is a perfect illustration.I can hear persuasive argumentsaround this table as to why it is going to go up and I can hearpersuasive arguments as to why it is going to stay down; and I don'tknow of any criteria by which I can choose between those two choicesat the moment.In a direct statistical sense that will be the mostimportant influence on the economic outlook in the near term. Thereare a couple of other things that might be mentioned that haven't beentouched upon. We have some uncertainty about tax refunds in the nearterm, with some expectation that they may be very high relative topast experience--I am talking about [the time period] between now andconsumer spending. What it will do to the near-term timing of thekind of forecast the staff has I think is an unknown.If one assumessome lag in defense spending but also assumes that the option of highdefense spending is going to come along [later], we could get apattern of big refunds for a while, in a sense artificially holdingthings up, followed by a defense impetus coming late in the year andtaking over after the refunds subside. It only adds to my feeling ofcaution about any forecast.So far as the bond market and the banking system and theavailability of credit are concerned, I'd just make two observations.2/4-5/80-45-I think the bond market people, who from the way they are behavingapparently are quite discouraged about the inflationary outlook, haveButI see one side of it.concluded that money is freely available.also, in talking to some bankers, I think there is something to whatFred Schultz just said about a cumulative impact of restriction.That's beginning to be felt by some bankers, who have talked to me,anyway, not only in consumer lending but in mortgage lending and insmall business lending and other types of lending.I think it is truethat the last ones to feel that are probably the big companies thathave access to the bond market and to the banks, too. I don't thinkthe picture is all one way. There has been great confusion about--Iguess it was John Balles who said it--whether the money supply isgenuinely [or only] statistically under control.I think it isstatistically under control. I am not sure the market thinks it isgenuinely under control. And it comes down in part to some confusionover our own operations.I meant to mention earlier--and I don't knowwhether the presidents have seen it--that we put out an elaboratetechnical explanation of what we're doing, which Mr. Axilrod authored.It has gotten no attention in the press thus far, but it was anattempt in considerable part to meet the questions that have beenarising about why reserves are going up 10 percent or 12 percent or 8percent, depending upon which number you're looking at, while themoney supply is going up 3 or 4 percent. I don't know whether we willconvince anybody as that seeps into consciousness.But there has beengreat confusion engendered by the differences in growth rates amongall these measures, including right now the various reserve measuresI will leave you with that.going off in widely different directions.Let's have the coffee break and when we return get back onthese long-term and short-term targets.[Coffee break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we can start. Let me make acouple of preliminary remarks and just devote our attention to thelong-term ranges at this point. One preliminary remark is that,whatever we do, I am afraid that we inevitably are going to have quitea lot of confusion with the changes in definitions [of the monetaryaggregates] coming at the same time as [the setting of our] targets.We are going to have a press briefing, not to give the targets, but toexplain the changes in definitions and the changes in patterns.Wehave had to add to all our other complications the usual annualrevision in seasonal patterns. We can now go forward and talk aboutthe new numbers but we are talking about them against the backgroundof an increase of almost 5 percent in January, if we can switch ourminds now from 1-3/4 percent or whatever was projected before on thebasis of the old numbers. The new M-1A and M-1B are growing atsomething like 4-3/4 percent in January, as I recall, which is prettymuch on the target that we set for ourselves by the grace of aIf policy fails, we can alwaysrevision in seasonal adjustments.revise the seasonal adjustment factors for a while![Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I do think this is going to be troublesometo explain, but we inevitably have to do it. Another complication,which we don't have to face right now, but it is inherent in this2/4-5/80-46-situation, is that basically the reason we have both M-1A and M-1B isto allow for growth in NOW accounts, and that [dichotomy] is atransitional device. The staff's judgment is that growth in M-1A andM-1B will not be any different this year if the law legalizing NOWaccounts doesn't pass. But the high probability is that that law willpass, presumably sometime during the spring, and that we will have tore-estimate M-1A and M-1B to allow for that; I presume we would wantto make a technical adjustment in the targets. I don't think we haveto worry about that now--maybe we can wait until midyear for ourregular revision anyway--but I just warn you that sometime during thespring, I suspect, if the law does pass, we think there will be asignificant difference between M-1A and M-1B and that some suitablechanges will have to made, if nothing else, consistent with what weOn the substance of the matter, if it is true that we face awide disparity of views in what the outlook might bring and a highdegree of uncertainty, I suspect we are on an approach--whatever othermerits or demerits there may be--that will provide us with some failsafe protection. [By that I mean] that if the economy really goesdown hill, almost any figure within the range of what we have beentalking about should produce an easing in the outward externalities ofpolicy, but if the fears of a stronger economy and an inflationarysurge appear, the opposite ought to happen. And I presume that in avery crude way, anyway, either of those results would be appropriate.When we discussed this the last time, there was a consensus--and maybefor a variety of reasons it was not quite unanimous--or a stronglypredominant view to maintain a 3 percentage point range, and all thesealternatives are couched that way. The ranges in the Bluebook fullyencompass all that people were talking about last time, I think. Thedifferences in the ranges are not very wide, as you know, and nobodyItis bound by what he or she said last time. To orient you a bit:was not true for everybody but the predominance of views fell betweenthe alternative II and alternative III choices shown here; and therewas actually some plurality if not a majority for alternative III.But people were talking in a preliminary way and rather loosely. Myown feeling is that we probably [should] end up in that area, and Idon't have enormous feelings that a difference of 1/2 percentage pointis of great significance. When we are in that area, the strength ofmy views is not pronounced among [those alternatives]. But judgingfrom the discussion last time, we are predominantly in that area. Sowith that introduction, who would like to be more precise in statingtheir views about where we should be for the annual range in 1980?Mr. Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, my feeling hasn't changed a lotsince our last meeting. It is true that the economic outlook haschanged somewhat from what most of us expected. In particular, thegovernment's demand on resources appears likely to be much greaterthan we earlier thought. But far from providing the reason forrelaxing or delaying this long-run task of ours of lowering the rateof growth in the aggregates, the inflationary dangers posed by thisfiscal stimulus suggest to me that the System needs to stick all themore firmly to the goal that it has often stated in the past. Themidpoints of alternative II look good to me. I was one of those whopreferred the narrower ranges last time. I would much prefer a 1percentage point range for M-1A and M-1B and a 2-point range for theother aggregates, M2 and M3, because of their interest volatility.2/4-5/80-47-Now, one can certainly argue that we need more flexibility since weinflation. I recognize the validity of that argument, but it seems tome that the narrower range would do a lot to enhance our credibility.Therefore, it would enhance a great deal the beneficial expectationaleffects that I think we'll get if we do in fact announce lower targetsthan what we have achieved in the past.I would be rather unhappy ifM-1A and M-1B, which are the two aggregates I consider most important,So, my figurescame out at the top of their alternative II ranges.would translate to 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M-1A, with a midpoint ofMy other ranges would be:5 percent, the same as in alternative II.M-lB, 5 to 6, with a midpoint of 5-1/2; M2, 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 with amidpoint of 7-1/2; M3, 7 to 9 with a midpoint of 8; and bank credit,6-1/2 to 8-1/2 with a midpoint of 7-1/2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just say a word. You reminded meabout M2, M3, and bank credit.First of all, I'd just note that ifpeople feel strongly about the weight to be put on those numbers, theyought to say so.Secondly, in the normal course of events, given theway we are operating they may get a little less weight than they havein the past because we won't have those figures as up to date. So faras I am concerned, I take on faith the staff analyses of theconsistency of the particular ranges they put down for those numbersas compared to Ml.I don't know of any strong reason why they shouldbe different from what the staff put down, but I have a littleresidual suspicion that those are indeed more volatile numbers thanthe M1 numbers because quite a lot does depend upon the evolution ofinterest rates, and I don't know in which direction they will go.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK. Well, I have said most of what I felt along thatline. I would emphasize M-1B because it catches the transactionbalances better; M-1A has lost a lot of the transaction balances.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Governor Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Well, Mr. Chairman, last time I indicated somepreliminary specifications that would have been consistent withalternative II.I want to argue this morning for alternative I.That's a difficult thing to do and I have always found myselfunsuccessful in such arguments in the past. But let me try it oncemore. The staff projection for nominal GNP, fourth quarter-to-fourthquarter, is for a 7 percent increase. The direction of thinking as wewent around the table was to convert that to a somewhat higher nominalGNP increase because almost everyone thought inflation would be a bithigher than the staff has projected, and quite a few people thoughtthat the decline might be a bit shallower than the staff hasprojected. So I would say that the Committee view, as opposed to thestaff view, is that nominal GNP will increase at least 8 percent. AndI believe the Administration, Jim, has a 9 percent increase in nominalGNP fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. In drawing these long-termranges, the relationship between money growth and the nominal GNP isof central importance because it really indicates the amount oftension there's likely to be in markets as the year goes on. And even7 percent [for nominal GNP growth] with a 5 percent midpoint on M-1Aand 5-1/2 percent on M-1B, which is alternative II, does imply anIf, in fact, we thinkincrease in velocity of a couple of points.nominal GNP [growth] is going to be a little higher than that--let'ssay 8 percent instead of 7 percent--it seems to me that as a matter of-48-2/4-5/80practicality and credibility in achieving the targets we set, we oughtto recognize that a bit in the specifications we pick. Going fromalternative II, which had been my former choice, to alternative I adds1/2 point to the midpoint. It makes the midpoint for M-1A 5-1/2percent and that for M-1B 6 percent, compared with, say, an 8 percentnominal GNP, and I think it does suggest a very considerable tensionon markets throughout the year. And it's [a target] that we might beable to achieve.I would point out one more thing: Every private forecastthat I have looked at, and I just reviewed them yesterday, suggests afederal funds rate at the end of this year of 10 percent or below.The only exception might be Salomon Brothers, but they don't specifythe funds rate in their projection. We are suggesting somethingaround 13 percent. The difference, I think, is in the impliedincrease in money in the private projections, which is stronger thanwe have. Now, if we go through a recession and hold the interest rateup throughout the recession--hold it pretty close to where it is now-start a recovery, say, a year hence or thereabouts with a rising trendof rates and high unemployment, we will have done really quite a lotto restrain the economy [through] monetary policy compared with anypast cycle that I can recall. And I think that also argues for beingjust a bit more liberal so that we'll have something we can achieve.I understand fully what Bob says about narrowing the ranges, and I doagree that there is quite a difference between, say, 4 percent and 7percent in M-1A, [which are the limits] in alternative I. But in theinterest of again being able to achieve growth this year within theranges we specify, which we managed to do for the first time in ourhistory in 1979, I think we need to hold the width of 3 points that wehave had but try to [achieve] the midpoint of the range. So, I wouldcome out with alternative I for the reasons that I have explained, andI would stay with the 3-point range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. I agree with those who have argued, startingwith Governor Teeters and others, that in view of all the economicuncertainty, we do need a lot of flexibility as the year unfolds. Andfor reasons that Chuck has just reviewed, I would support the idea ofhaving a 3-point range. As I often do when we get to this time of theyear, I like to speak to the two faces of the ranges that we arediscussing here. The one face is the public reaction or theannouncement effects, for what they are worth. They may not be wortha lot, but I can't believe they have no effects at all. I admit, asTed Truman pointed out to us yesterday, that the public pays moreattention to what we do than to what we say we are going to do. Butreverting to my earlier deep concern about an apparent re-escalationof inflationary expectations over the last month--[manifested] invarious ways, especially in the rise of long-term bond yields to newhighs, as I pointed out--I think there is a lot to be said for pickingranges just in terms of public announcement effects that are bothbroad, because as I have already indicated we need the flexibility inview of the economic uncertainty that lies ahead, and that would tendto ensure that we do in fact get continued deceleration in monetarygrowth. Our record since October has, in fact, been very good onthat. But I am afraid that there's some skepticism among marketparticipants and others that we may not persist. One way of puttingthat skepticism to bed, or at least helping to diminish it, would be-49-2/4-5/80to have upper limits on our ranges which even if hit would stillFor thatinvolve slightly less monetary growth in 1980 than in 1979.reason, I would support alternative II with respect to both M-1A andM-1B because even if we hit the upper end of 6-1/2 percent in the caseof M-1A, that would be less than the 6.8 percent growth of last year.And even if we hit the upper end of the alternative II range of 4 to 7percent for M-1B, growth would be less than the 8 percent growth wehad last year. And for the same reasons, I would choose thealternative III ranges for M2 and M3.The upper end of thealternative III range for M2 is 8-1/2 percent, below last year's 8.8percent actual.In the case of M3, the alternative III range of 6 to9 percent is below the 9-1/2 percent actual we had last year. So ifthere is any sense at all in what I am saying about the publicperception of the maximum [rates of growth] we specify, assuming thatunder our new operating procedures we didn't exceed the upper limitsof the ranges, those upper limits would involve at least a 1/2 pointwhether we should target all four of these, Mr. Chairman, I have gravedoubts.I think M-1A is still so influenced--or perhaps contaminated,to use a word my research staff is fond of using--by past and ongoinginstitutional changes that I personally would be prepared to drop itright now and put our faith in M-1B.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it will only rise because it's takingfunds out of M2.M-1A will go down.[M-1B] will rise because it'staking out of M2; and M-1A will decline because [funds will be taken]out of that aggregate.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Well, in short, I would like to make a pitch fortargeting M-1B and M2 as opposed to targeting M-1A and M-1B, [assuggested] in the draft directive language. Our own experience in thepast has led us to place somewhat more confidence, in terms of the olddefinitions, in M2 as a predictor of inflation and real GNP. Ofcourse, it remains to be seen whether that is going to hold for thenew M2. But based on some of the statistical tests that we've done,M-1A is certainly the least reliable predictor of real GNP of the fouraggregates mentioned. The differences are quite significant, andthat's why I am somewhat disillusioned about M-1A. We've tested itretrospectively and view it as a considerably poor forecaster offuture real GNP. That is the main reason I would like to drop it.Those are my recommendations, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. I think we face more inflation and lessrecession than would have been [the case] before recent changes in theeconomy. Now the question is: How does one finance a higher nominalGNP with a given amount of money supply? In Chuck's calculation youhave to look at the nominal GNP and ask how it can be financed fromthe rise in money, and a rise in velocity is very logical. Moreover,one can't say nowadays that we would get some rise in velocity out ofrising interest rates because presumably we wouldn't. So we'redependent, really, on the amount of money growth in the effectivemoney supply--that is, the amount of money growth plus the regulargrowth in velocity at a constant interest rate. And I think the staffputs the drift in the demand function at about 2 percent.Since we've opened up the question of the aggregates, I wouldlike to express some doubt not only about M-1A, on which I share whatothers have said, but M-1B. In general I think we are not yetincluding everything that acts like money, and we probably never will.Money market accounts and mutual funds are not in M-l, although Iwould suspect that they have a very strong effect on people's holdingsof demand balances. That is, they aren't used for transactions--theirvelocity is low--but they are very good substitutes for a cashbalance. I hear that brokerage firms are now setting up, in effect,zero balance overdraft facilities. If that takes over, one needs nocash balance at all any more; one can just finance one's current needsagainst one's stock holdings. There are Eurodollars, of which we[include] what seems to be a small part in the aggregates. I don'tthink we capture even all the Eurodollars owned by U.S. residentsbecause we don't know their total and we certainly don't include anypart of Eurodollars owned by nonresidents, even though one would thinksome of those dollars are going to be used in the United States, notfor purchases of goods and services but for purchases of assets, whichinfluence our interest rates and so on. So, I think the monetaryaggregate [targets] are really symbols of restraint--orders ofmagnitude, but not to be taken at face value. If we did take them atface value, I'd say look at M2 and you will find that underalternative I [the staff] projects [growth at] 9-1/2 percent, theupper limit. That's more than [the projected] nominal GNP increasefor 1980, which I believe is about 8 percent, so we'd be overfinancing in those terms. This does not allow for any drift in themoney function.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.There's no drift on M2.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. There may be no drift in M2, but that dependson how one believes these extraordinary items, Eurodollars and soforth, impinge. Well, that leads me to alternative III. I think wedo need wide ranges because it's simply impossible to target severalaggregates and make them consistent using anything like a singlenumber. I would place a great deal of weight on M2 for the reasons Ihave given. I think [alternative III] is consistent with financing [anominal] GNP increase of about 8 percent.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Willes.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just couldn'tdisagree more with some of the comments I have heard and I agreeentirely with some others. Chuck and I have this running discussionabout how we finance nominal GNP. He has his view. My view is that-51-2/4-5/80if you try to do [it his way], you just chase your tail. If in factthere is a relationship between money and inflation, by persistentlytrying to finance nominal GNP we end up generating more inflation-even at an accelerating rate--which therefore we have to finance andso on. So I would hope we would not take that [route].

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. Oh, I don't disagree with that. It's a questionof whether one thinks this [degree] of weakness in the economy isreasonable.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. That's right. Now, what I find most puzzling-and I will copy one of Fred Schultz's lines, which I always thoughtwas mine, and that is that I have a very simple mind-MR. SCHULTZ.Well, some of us will agree with that!

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES. I would think, if we agree that the outlook isvery uncertain, that rather than arguing for more flexibility we wouldargue for less. That's because if the time pattern of the economy isvery unpredictable, then there's no way we can respond to change it ina predictable way and, therefore, we ought not to be responding. Weought to respond less rather than more, the greater the uncertaintyabout the outlook. As a consequence, unlike Nancy's and John'searlier suggestion that we do all we can to preserve our flexibility,I would say just the opposite. I think we ought to pick a path thatwe want to follow for the long term and stick to that path as long aswe can unless we receive major information that suggests we're way outof [line] for one reason or another. Of course, rational expectationswould say that even if we got such information, it's not clear wecould do anything about it and, therefore, we ought not to respond.Having said all that, obviously, I would much prefer thespecifications of alternative III. That looks like a very large dropfor M-1B from [growth of] 8 percent in 1979 to [a range with an upperlimit of] 6-1/2 percent in 1980. But the Bluebook says on theprevious page that for the last six months M-1B growth has only been6.1 percent, so the drop isn't as big as it might appear from the[table] on page 6. So, I would go with alternative III. I must say Iam in the group that thinks the range is too wide. I would beconcerned if money [growth] dropped, assuming we are measuringanything corresponding to money, down to3 percent.On the otherhand, I would certainly hate to see it above 6 percent. So, I'dprefer a narrower range but would not want growth to go above 6percent on M-1A or 6-1/2 percent on M-1B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There's a [trickiness] of these figures.I think it's fair to say that M-1A was artificially high last yearbecause we did get some transition [flows] into NOW and ATS accounts,part of which came out of M2. Mr. Kimbrell.

[SECTION]

MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, one specific thing I would liketo see is that the 1980 targets be related to the 1979 targets and notthe 1979 results. We are all [talking about] the uncertainties. Ofcourse, there does not seem to be much uncertainty about [the risks ofa] recession and all of us are accepting that there are going to beinflationary tendencies and expectations. And I feel that our actionsshould attempt not to provide any unnecessary opportunities for strongmoney growth. I would hope that we indeed will begin to lower thesemonetary goals gradually. For that reason I also accept the thesis of-52-2/4-5/80narrower ranges, not more than 2 percentage points, and frankly with aSo Istrong determination to achieve them and control [money growth].would [narrow] the alternative III ranges and I end up with 3-1/2 to5-1/2 percent on M-1A, 4 to 6 percent on M-1B, and 6 to 8 percent forM2.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Smoot.

[SECTION]

MR. SMOOT. Governor Partee argued for alternative I, basedon the higher anticipated nominal GNP. Looking at my own staff'sprojections, our nominal GNP figures would be somewhat higher than theBoard's. But they also encompass a money supply growth rate in the4-1/2 to 5 percent range. Depending on which one of those I pick, Iam indifferent between alternative II and alternative III, which Ithink is where you were, Chairman Volcker. If I had to choose, Iwould choose alternative II based on the observation, which is madequite clearly in the Bluebook, that all of these alternatives suggesta lower rate of growth in money than occurred last year. And if wepay any attention to the long-term trend in money growth, then we arecoming down from a higher trend level. I must say that I have faith,as you do, that the staff's ranges are consistent; at least thenumbers for M-1B, M2, etc., appear to be consistent, and I wouldn'tquibble with those. So, based on that, we would be agreeable toalternative II.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Mayo.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. Mr. Chairman, unlike the humility of Mr. Schultzand Mr. Willes about being somewhat simple-minded, I must be humble insaying that my mind finds things very complicated. I have tried hardto move toward being simple-minded on some of these things. We havedifferent approaches to some of these problems. However, I find thatthe factors are so complicated and have such a margin of error that Imust stick to the 3-point range. Some people might accuse the Fed ofbeing a bit cowardly because the range is so wide. But the factorsthat we are dealing with are indeed so complicated that we must allowourselves this flexibility. I feel, if anything, even more stronglythan John Balles put it that we are [making this] unduly complicated.Again, I am striving toward being a little simpler. We are making ithard, and even harder for you, Mr. Chairman, when you try to explainto your audience on Thursday why we have decided to use both M-1A andM-1B when both of them will need adjustment when we get NOW accounts.And I agree we will get them nationwide. I think we'd look a lot moresensible to forget M-1A--as I said last time and I'll say it againthis time--and call it Ml, show some change, and not give theimpression by stressing M-1A that the lion has labored and hasproduced a mouse. There's too little change from the old M1 in whatwe are proposing, and I would rather see us stick with M-1B and givethe explanation of the adjustment in NOW accounts in a simple-mindedfashion rather than try to adjust both M-1A and M-1B to NOW accountswhen they come. This is the way in which my attempt to be simpleminded would direct us. I'd prefer alternative II with the 3-pointrange. I'd obviously prefer to concentrate just on M-1B and call itM1, [with a range of] 4 to 7 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chuck Partee has movedfrom one recommendation to another from last month to this month andI will also, but going the other way. Last month we were looking at asomewhat weaker economy and it seemed that perhaps the inflation ratewould fall off a bit through 1980. Also, the deceleration from whatactually happened in 1979 to what I would like to consider our target--the midpoint [of any of] the ranges [we select]--from about 7percent [growth] to 5 percent for M-1A, for example, seemed fairlyfast. And that is the reason last month that I would have opted forwhat now appears to be alternative I. But things have changed, atleast to my mind. We're now looking at a bit stronger economy through1980, as I tried to outline earlier today. Secondly, and moreimportantly, inflation quite likely will stay at the present level oreven accelerate as we get into the latter part of next year. As aresult, what we do on the monetary side seems extremely important.That leads me to say that I would go to alternative II, which has amidpoint--what I [consider] the target--of 5 percent. Whatever we'vesaid about ranges, they are unimportant to me except in how the publicperceives them. I would hope whatever targets this Committee sets,whether on the long run or the short run, that the Desk at least inits month-to-month or day-to-day operations will look at themidpoints.So, I am looking at 5 percent for M-1A or 5-1/2 percentfor M-1B. And I share Bob Mayo's view on going to M1 and doing awaywith M-1A and M-1B. I think they will confuse more than we will beable to explain.

MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, I consider myself neither simpleminded nor complicated-minded, but just poorly educated for thisforum. Having said that, I would have some preference on thetechnical side for the wider 3-point range shown. In terms of theaggregates to focus on, my preferences would be M-1A and M2. We havecommented around the table about growth in bank credit and I do thinkthe Desk should be asked to keep an eye on that number, which haslooked so high the past year. My position is no different than it waslast month. I look forward to having the yearly goals show a gradualreduction in the aggregates.I am most impressed by the commentsPeter Sternlight made yesterday about inflationary expectations in theI think there will be a great focus on these goals as youannounce them later this month; people will be looking for anindication of the posture of the Federal Reserve at this particularpoint in time. I might say, too, that as they look at our long-termgoals, they will [do so with] the immediate impression of economicdevelopments at the start of the year. January, I believe, will lookstrong. It may have an impact on the entire first quarter; people maynot discount it, as Fred Schultz has suggested, as being all due togood weather.So, my preference is alternative III as stated in theBluebook. And I would pick up the thought that Nancy Teeters notedearlier: That we will have opportunities to change the ranges atmidyear in the event that some of the gloomy prospects do actuallycome to fruition. But I don't share the gloomy prospects personally.

We are questioning the function; we arequestioning the seasonals. I think the expectations have shifted onus.

MR. COLDWELL. Yes, that's quite correct. In the coming yearit looks to me as if we're talking about a GNP increase anywhere inthe 8 to 10 percent range and maybe up to as high as 11 percent--thatencompasses most of the forecasts I heard this morning--and makingsome progress in reducing the stimulation that both monetary andfiscal policy have added these past few years. I have to come out infavor of a much tighter monetary policy. And I would pick up on somepeople's comments in that I would hate to see another 6 percentincrease in the monetary growth. So, I would put the target at 3 to 5percent, centered on 4 percent with a 2-point spread.

While I agree with Governor Parteethat we want to be mindful of the amount of tension that we create inthe economy with respect to what we expect on nominal GNP growth, onthe other hand I also agree with Governor Wallich that we want to lookat this point at M2 with regard to the provision for nominal GNP.That brings me to alternative II, with the range remaining at thewider 3-point spread.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, last month I argued foralternative III, but on further reflection that seems a bit too tight,so I would move to alternative II. I would keep the 3-point range,however, because I think it is important for our credibility that weend up with a result that's within the range. I think the experienceof the last few months may have led us to believe that we can controlthe money supply much more finely than in fact is going to be thecase. We have been very lucky, you know, in the last few months. Inthis last month all of the misses in our estimates offset each othernicely; that is, the deposit mix estimates were offset by the excessreserve estimate. Furthermore, even though we came in low on M1, wesolved that problem by revising the seasonals. We're going to runinto times when we find we are not going to be able to control themoney supply quite as readily; and if we move to a very narrow range,we may regret it.

At the last meeting, I mademention of Heisenberg's theory of uncertainty, which in physics is atheory that when you try to observe sub-atomic particles the act ofobservation changes the way they act so you never know exactly wherethey are. I think that some of the same principles apply here and itseems to me that we should not try to be too precise at this point intime. These numbers are going to be revised. That's clear. Sometime during the year, for some reason, we're going to have to engagein some revision. So, I would agree with Mr. Winn that there is some-57-2/4-5/80considerable impact in terms of [reactions to] the numbers we announceand I would come down on alternative III.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Mr. Baughman.

[SECTION]

MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I am inclined pretty much alongthe line on which Bob Black started this discussion in that narrowerranges would seem desirable. And if we take a narrower range, then itseems to me that alternative II is appropriate. If we retain the widerange as stated in the Bluebook, which I am characterizing as wide,then I would be inclined to alternative III so as to get the ceilingsdown a bit. I am impressed also with Governor Wallich's comments. Infact, I have been inclined to postulate that the pace at which moneysubstitutes or near monies are developed is quite possibly a functionof the degree of restraint that we are attempting to impose upon thesystem. Consequently, the system may have substantial leakage or,alternatively, substantial elasticity. And that would tend to arguein favor of moving to pretty low numbers for the growth rates of theitems reported here. I rather expect that is what we will experienceas we move through the next two or three years and that we will haveto move to growth rates in these conventional measures well below anythat are currently contemplated if, in fact, we are going to make muchimpact on inflation. In presenting your views, I would think you aregoing to have to say something about 1981 as well as 1980. And itseems to me some rationalization along that line may be required interms of fitting the growth rate numbers projected for 1980 with theidea that we need to have an annual reduction in the growth ratenumbers until we do get to a non-inflationary environment.

MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I am a little at a loss tounderstand why some of our colleagues, who I know are much moreeconomically sophisticated and learned than I am, express confusionand concern as to whether or not we have a fundamental policy mandateand whether or not we can accomplish that. If one looks at this in asimplistic fashion, [one thing is] certain: We have told the worldthat our primary objective is a reduction in inflation accomplished ona gradual basis so as to avoid, if possible, drastic recessionaryconsequences.And we have said we're going to accomplish thatobjective by gradually reducing the rate of growth of the monetaryaggregates. It seems to me that there has been overwhelming approval,both in the press and the public, and very little expression ofdisapproval of this basic policy objective. To me the biggest problemfacing us, as I hear from people in our community, is a broad doubt orskepticism as to our willingness or ability to accomplish theseobjectives. I vehemently disagree with those of you who say that itis questionable whether or not we can gradually reduce the growth ofthe monetary aggregates. We can do it. We can do it either bycontrolling the path of total reserves or controlling the monetarybase or a combination of both. I am a little concerned about the factthat we don't spend more time reflecting on what the monetary base andnonborrowed reserves and total reserves have done, as described onIn ordercan accomplish our monetary aggregate growth [objectives].to do what we've said we're going to do, we have to strive for a 5 or5-1/2 percent rate of growth in M-1A or M-1B over the next year. Idon't think we can react to short-term shortfalls or overruns on these2/4-5/80-58-[aggregates]. Anybody who says what has happened in the last two orthree weeks is a cause for alarm just doesn't understand how thisprocess works. We have to set long-term targets and we have to stickwith those long-term targets unless and until there are fundamentalchanges in public thinking and fundamental changes in our policy thatwould [point] toward our retreating from these longer-term targets.I would agree with Mark and others that it would bepreferable, if we could possibly swallow this enormous step, to narrowour ranges so that we indeed can accomplish a 5 or 5-1/2 percentgrowth. I don't think it's our job to try to position ourselves sothat our targets are so broad that we can always say we accomplishedour targets if the world [falls apart] while we're protecting our ownreputations. Our reputation is on the line. People totally andbroadly subscribe to what the Chairman has announced and I don't thinkwe can enjoy the luxury anymore of vacillating. The fat is in thefire and I think a narrow range under either alternative II or IIIaround 5 percent for the M-1A and M-1B targets would be the best wayto accomplish this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There's obviously a majority for retaininga 3-point range, as there was last month. I would defend that in myown mind by the uncertainty of the figures that Frank Morris andothers have referred to and the real uncertainty in the economy, whichgoes in the direction of [our needing] a little leeway. I would notein that regard that I don't know of another central bank in the world,however monetarist oriented, that has a narrower target than 3percentage points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do the Swiss have a pretty good record?They had something like a 15 percent increase in the money supply insome recent year, and they abandoned the target.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. I mean the range has to be seen relative to therate of inflation. At 10 percent inflation, 3 percent [growth inmoney] isn't much. At 2 percent [inflation] it would be a great deal.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.I think we can get off this subject.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS. The Swiss did that on a contrived basis, though,to make their goods more competitive. It wasn't because the mechanismis not workable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Be that as it may, the greatest singleview is for alternative III. There is a certain amount of clusteringat alternative II, and one for alternative I. And there are some in2/4-5/80-59-between alternatives II and III and between II and I. One possibleapproach would be to adopt the Balles approach, which he justified inpart in terms of the desirability of getting all the upper limits nohigher than the growth we had last year. He [suggested] a combinationbetween alternatives II and III, using the alternative II ranges onthe Mls and something like the ranges in alternative III on M2 and M3,if I understood him correctly. I assume the staff judgment as to theinternal consistencies of these ranges is not so precise that thatbecomes an impossible [combination].

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. No, it doesn't become impossible, Mr. Chairman.But I remember last year that the old M2 ran above the projection, andthat is the aggregate the Committee has come closest to cutting downto just about the lowest that is economically sustainable. I wouldjust add that point. I think we gave very low, or conservative,estimates for M2. So there is some danger in it.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Well, in the old days, I would have said itwould have ballooned. Nowadays, with interest rates so far aboveceiling rates, we don't have that effect. We have put the moneysubstitutability between the money market funds and other elements ofM2. The risk is for higher growth if interest rates decline, but Idon't think it is nearly as great a risk as it used to be.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. I might just point out that M2 [growth in 1979]was very close to the upper limit on alternative II, John, and for M3[actual growth] was the same as the upper limit on alternative II.The aggregate that is really low is bank credit. I don't quiteunderstand that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, these are in my judgment very narrowdifferences. Let me just try, after everybody has listened to all ofthis, two alternatives: alternative III straight and alternative IIstraight. I might say it didn't make much difference in clarifyingany strong preference to add the views of nonvoting members onto thoseof the members; they're split in about the same way. So just for thevoting members, after hearing each other, how many would wantalternative III?

MR. SCHULTZ. I understand what he proposed. He's justtaking a somewhat mechanistic approach. But I am thinking of whatactually happens in the economy. It seems to me that if we're goingto go away from alternative III, which is the alternative I continueto prefer, where we should ease is in M2 and M3 rather than the otherway around. Is that the wrong way to look at it?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that seems to be a bit in line withMr. Axilrod's suspicions, for whatever that's worth. On the otherhand, it doesn't achieve Mr. Balles's visual purpose.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. I don't understand that there's any particularreason to ease on M-1A and M-1B because I have some real questionsabout velocity. But if Mr. Axilrod is right, the figures on M2 and M3are likely to be more stringent than those on M-1A and M-1B.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN. Is there any understanding as to where in therange the Desk would be shooting for?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, theoretically, we are shooting forthe midpoint, based on what we know now. We may modify that in theshort-run decision; we haven't gotten there. But for the year as awhole the implication is that the best judgment we can make is thatwe're shooting at the middle of all of these, which gives us someleeway on [M2 and M3] presumably, if we're really shooting at themiddle of the [target for Ml].

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. My presumption, Mr. Chairman, is that of coursewe would aim for the midpoint, but I would also very quickly add thatin view of all the uncertainty we would want to be able to move eitherway, including to the top of the range. I think we ought to keep thatflexibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would agree with that.But as of now Ithink we are saying the central tendency is the midpoints of theseranges, which gives us some potential leeway in deliberately movingaway from the midpoint and also gives us some leeway in thereconciliation among these various numbers. I suppose the implicationof that, to sell [this] alternative now, is that if we were literallyaiming for the midpoints throughout the year and M2 and M3 prove to bea little tight relative to the Mls, we would end up with a slightlylower M1 and a slightly higher M2 and M3, relative to the midpoints.If the staff estimate is correct and everything went perfectly, that'spresumably the way [it would turn out].We would end up with themidpoint, theoretically, halfway between alternative II andalternative III.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, if the Committee is willing toaccept a range of 2-1/2 points, an almost perfect compromise is totake the bottoms of alternative II and the tops of alternative III.

MR. PARTEE.That results in odd midpoints.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You obviously know [the area we're in].Ireally am resistant to getting down to 1/4 points. If what we'reaiming at for M-1A is halfway between [the midpoints of] alternativesII and III, [that difference is] 1/4 of a percentage point and I thinkwe're really there with the Balles approach as a practical matter.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. Are we not likely, though, to end up with asituation in which we're going to miss on both sides with the Ballesapproach? M2 and M3 may be strong and M-1A and M-1B could be prettyweak.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Presumably these are the best estimates wehave. I will not vouch for the inter-relationships between them.[They represent] an unbiased estimate of the consistent-MR. AXILROD. We rounded these to 1/2 points, by the way.For M2 and M3 I think the [actual] differences are 1/4 points amongthe alternatives.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're now unrounding them. Let me urgeupon you at this point the Balles alternative. How many find thatacceptable after this further [discussion]?

MS. TEETERS. You realize we're already in trouble in termsof being in conformity with the Administration's forecast. At leastyou have to do the testifying on Humphrey-Hawkins. We're alreadyinconsistent; this is making it worse.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. The President has given up on Humphrey-Hawkinsfor this coming year anyway. He moved out [the time period in whichto reach the objectives].

MS. TEETERS. He may have moved it out but theAnd we will have toAdministration's forecast is markedly different.go up to the Hill and say we're going to keep money so tight thatthere is no way that the Administration's forecast can be realized.That's about what it comes down to.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.I am really much more concerned about M2 and M3than I am M-1A or M-1B because at these interest rates and theseinflation rates I am very unsure of the connection between the two.And I think there is going to be a demand shift this year. The staffindicates that they can see no indication yet, but-MR. PARTEE.[It can] hardly be bigger than it was last year.We already had a great big demand shift in the recorded figures forlast year. For M-1B, which I think a lot of people would support asthe better redefined money, our midpoint will be 3 points below whatwe realized last year. Three points!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that figure is a little artificialbecause we had the shift into ATS and NOW accounts.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. This is a question of fact, Mr. Chairman. Whatimpressions do you have as to whether the Congressional Committeeconsiders the ranges as having a very strong implication that we'llmove toward the midpoint? I haven't gathered that that was true inInthe past; we have ranges with the precise idea of being flexible.house we may well aim for a midpoint. But in terms of the Congress,is my impression wrong that they look on these as ranges we feel freeto utilize fully depending on unfolding conditions?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I can't answer that question. It probablyimplies a degree of sophistication on the part of Congress that isbeyond any generalization.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. There seems to be a feeling around the tablehere that if we adopt alternative III, we're struck with themidpoints.I don't think we are, frankly.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.What else is the Desk going to aim for?What's the purpose of having the range?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'd certainly have a tendency right nowto aim for the midpoint, not knowing anything else. That's pendingfurther information.2/4-5/80-70-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I was going to suggest the opposite.If there's more of a concern about M2 and M3, maybe we should take a1/2 percentage point off the top of the M1 ranges.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Then you have more substitutability among thedeposits?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.M2 and M3.

SPEAKER(?).2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent on M-1A?No.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [For M-1A] 3-1/2 to 6 percent--acompromise between alternatives II and III on both the Mls.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.All right.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.And 4 to 6-1/2--I'd go for that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's 4 to 6-1/2 percent on M-1B, which isprobably going to have to be revised anyway.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.I'd be happy.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.There's a bit of logic in it, I think.-71-2/4-5/80

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.That's logical, and I like that.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Just a comment on that, Mr. Chairman:Thereason I was turned off by alternative II for M2 and M3 is that if wewent for the upper end of that range, which I presume we could, thatwould result in no decrease at all in the growth rates of those twomagnitudes for 1980 from what we experienced in 1979.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.If we go right to the top.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).We also have to recognize that they're ratheruncontrollable by us with money market funds and Eurodollars andCaribbean dollars and RPs in there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We lose that visual effect, but it'sgetting argued that the economics are a little against us in terms ofthe uncertainty and it gives wider ranges. I think there's a certainsense in doing that. It has the disadvantage that-MR. COLDWELL.So the midpoint on M-1A would be 4-3/4percent?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.with that quarter percent.That's right.[Unintelligible]mislead

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. That's just raising it, on average, because thelower ends don't really mean anything.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Well, they could.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.It's raising depending upon where webegin.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Well, it seems that we'd very likely dosomething if it came out there. Even I would be prepared to do that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say raising on average. Depending onwhat one is looking at, it's accepting the upper constraint ofalternative III on M1. That's the one you're worried about.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Well, I was more worried about M2, and there wehave an increase. Raising the lower constraints on M-1A and M-1Bdoesn't really accomplish anything.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's try this one. I appeal toyou: Anyone around this table who is good enough to know thedifference between 1/2 point, with great [conviction], is pretty good.

MR. AXILROD. I will skip the introductory part, a page and ahalf, which says that interest rates aren't projected to come down asmuch as they used to be because the economy is projected to bestronger.[Secretary's note:For the full text of Mr. Axilrod'sstatement, see Appendix.]

MR. AXILROD. I would guess it's a shade lower because theold M2 is running a shade lower.It's either consistent or a shadelower. I haven't worked it out in detail month by month on money

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it has been running higher than 6-1/2percent, apparently, because you have the implied growth for Januaryto March of 5-3/4 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. Yes. The actual growth in M2 is 8.3 percentbecause, among other reasons, we had this very sharp expansion inmoney market funds in January, which we've been expecting to slow.2/4-5/80-75-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There's a question of procedure we have towe had for the first quarter.[We can comment on] any tentativefeeling that we have about the second quarter but we don't have to putthe second quarter into the directive, and I think it's probablyinappropriate to put the second quarter in the directive at thispoint.So, if people agree with this, the only thing we have to havein the directive is a number for the first quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. To be clear, Mr. Chairman, alternative B, as weconstrue it, is simply reiterating the Committee's policy of last timewith respect to M1.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Right.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. That's in new terms and takes account of theactual growth that occurred in January.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And in both cases--just slightly in thecase of Ml and a little more than slightly in the case of M2--the rateof growth in January was above our targets [for the quarter].

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.Yes.But, again, this is a totally differentM2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.Yes, after we translate them.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. But the old M2 is running a little lowerrelative to target than we had expected.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So if we take alternative B, conceivablywe could shade it a bit in the light of our earlier discussion. But Ithink we're talking-MR. PARTEE.I think what we'd shade is the second quarter.After all, the first quarter-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that would be my inclination.Looking at this in view of what we just decided, the second quarterfigures may be a little high. But we don't have to decide upon thatnow. Otherwise, what you're saying is that "B" is basicallyreiterating what we said before, which does imply a little slowergrowth rate in February and March than we in fact had in January.That's because January was high in M2--and M1 came out a little bit onthe high side, but not very much--because of the money market fundbulge. I would suggest to you, but I don't want to hasten you ifthere's some vital question that I am missing, that just for the firstquarter "B" is reasonable. I think it's not only in line with what we

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. Are we content with a point target here?the way we should read this?Is that

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is the central tendency, obviously.Last time we worded it 4 to 5 percent on Ml.We could raise thequestion again of whether we want to continue with that wording. Wesaid 4 to 5 percent on M1 and about 7 percent on M2.I suppose whatwe'd be saying here is that the Committee reiterated--if you want to-76-2/4-5/80word it that way--the 4 to 5 percent range on Ml.basis, we'd shave the target a half point.And on the new M2

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. There could be some argument, Paul, that we'refarther along in the quarter and should narrow that range. Or wecould say 4-3/4 percent, which is-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't feel strongly about that.Even on the new technique we're not that close. This is a pure matterof preference; we can word it either way. I don't have any-MS. TEETERS.I would prefer to word it "4 to 5 percent."

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.I think there's a lot to be said for stabilityfrom month to month in these directives, unless there's a major reasonto change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Particularly if we keep that same wording,we'd be a little hard pressed to [rationalize] changing it by aquarter percentage point, which one could argue we might want to do onthe basis of the long-term range, all else being equal.But that'ssuch a fine adjustment. More substantively one could argue, givenwhat's going on, that we might want to be tighter or easier.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. I would argue for alternative C with aborrowing level of $1.6 billion.

MS. TEETERS.I think we should stick to where we were.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER."B" says that we want to play it aboutwhere we've been playing it; "A" says we distinctly want to be alittle easier. I think those are the choices here.

If there's a lot of argument that weshould be distinctly tighter or if the differences are massive, [maybewe should break for lunch].In fact if we took "C," I think we wouldhave to raise the targeted level of borrowing.

MR. WALLICH. The measure of tightness in the face of higherinflation is not the money supply. It is really the interest rate, orthe real interest rate. I see that as having come down.

MR. WINN. Paul, there's another question. Maybe this is notrelevant, but in view of our unwillingness to come to terms with thelagged reserve question and in view of my nervousness with respect toour luck in holding out on this setup, is this perhaps the appropriatetime to raise the question, given the fluctuations in borrowings andthe growing differential between market rates and the discount rate,about changing the rate as part of this picture of [unintelligible]?

MR. WALLICH. I think we should be clear on what overallresponse we want and to me that is expressed in the funds rate.

MR. COLDWELL. I think we have a chance here to make a nibbleinto that long-term range; and if we give that up now, we may not havea chance later on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the funds rate is theoretically notpredictable under what we're doing. But if we go toward "C," we arebiasing it, presumably-MR. COLDWELL.On the upper part of the range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --on the upper part or for an increasefrom where we are. Not knowing anything else, I don't know what wouldactually happen. But presumably we would push the level of borrowingsup a bit, which might or might not push the funds rate up. In "B," wewould not push the borrowings up, which might or might not beaccompanied by stability in the funds rate.-78-2/4-5/80

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.In that period it was 3/4 of a point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe we could say 4 to 5 percent for M-1Aand 1/2 point higher for M-lB.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. The average borrowing for January was $1.2billion, and that's what we were suggesting as the initial level.Iwould add that, following that very sharp spurt in borrowing lastweek, partly because the Desk is aiming at [a lower level], borrowinghas been running much lower this week; it's averaging about $892million so far.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL.But consistent with "B,"you're talking $1billion?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD. We mentioned $1.2 billion in the Bluebook.Previously, at the last meeting, $1 billion was discussed; butborrowing seemed to be running higher than that. So it's a fuzzyquestion as to where precisely borrowing is going to want to end up.But we suggested $1.2 billion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The borrowing figure has been very fuzzyrecently, to say the least. Whatever figure we think about now mightbe adjusted fairly promptly in the light of whatever numbers come in.What I am saying, partly in the interest of consistency, is that weare looking for M-1A between 4 and 5 percent and M-1B between 4-1/2and 5-1/2--or we could say 1/2 point higher. I don't know if there'sany preference between those. Then there is somewhat of a technicalproblem in that we don't get the M2 figure as early, but I think itcould be said that we believe this is consistent with an M2 figure, asnewly defined, of about 6-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. COLDWELL. That says that nothing has happened since thelast time we discussed this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Basically, I think it does. That's theissue:Whether we want to take this opportunity to make a change inwhat we laid down a month ago.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH. Well, I think there has been a distinctperception of a higher rate of inflation by the public. And there hasbeen a challenge on whether or not we are still hanging in tough.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ. I think alternative B represents somerestraint. Restraint is continuing and we're beginning to see it inthe things that I called attention to.I would not like to see uschange from alternative B.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. The only reason we don't have a considerableshortfall is because of that seasonal adjustment.Otherwise, we arehanging with a policy that gives us a shortfall.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this is the issue. It involves notjust what we want to do now but has some future implications as to howmuch we want to fine-tune these numbers at monthly intervals or theintervals at which we meet.Sometimes we are going to want to change2/4-5/80-80-them, I think, so I am not completely allergic to it.very small change between "B" and "C."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Consistent with the decision we just madefor the long run, "B" has a very slight amount of front-end loading,if you mean by front-end loading going below the-MR. COLDWELL.More restraint.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS. Well the January-to-March growth implied by "B"is well below what happened in January. So, by definition, we'regoing to get some tightening.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In any event, we will get a slight amountif these numbers come out that precisely. All these numbers imply aslightly slower rate of growth than what we actually had in January.And I think we could say in the policy record at the very least thatthat implication exists.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, if it's your preference to statethis as ranges of 4 to 5 percent and 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, is theimplication that the Desk would aim for the midpoint?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I think that is true for this period.I have a slight preference for a range just because we are never goingto hit the exact figure anyway--we're not that good--and it justBut the implicationindicates that there's a little [flexibility].clearly is that for now we aim for the midpoint. Now, what we do asthe period [progresses] if we get outside it in either direction andwhether it's practical to get all the way back to the midpoint [is thequestion].There is some flexibility [with a range], but I don't feelstrongly as to whether it's stated as a midpoint or-MR. BALLES. With the understanding, whether it's in therecord or not, that we would in fact [aim] for the midpoint, I for onewould find it acceptable. My preference would be to be a little moreprecise in the instructions to the Desk as to what to aim for andrecognize that we might not be able to hit it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's separate these two questions.Let me just get a show of hands. Who basically wants to keep themidpoint where we had it, with the modification that means [given] achange in the [M2] definition, but does not want to say that we want adifferent basic [objective for] money growth in the first quarter?This recognizes that that means a slightly lower rate of growth in

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.I think we're better off stating them all as"abouts"--"about 5" and I guess "about 6-1/2."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right. The alternative is sayingabout 4-1/2 percent and--. Well, I think the 6-1/2 percent ought tobe worded differently because we don't have that number right away andwe can't have the implication that we're following that week by weekbecause we just don't have it.So, with that change in language, it's4-1/2 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, which I notice ishalfway between "B" and "C."And then "The Committee believes that isconsistent with about 6-1/2 percent for M2 as newly defined."

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO. How do you explain, Paul, why we have a pointtarget even with the "about" in front of it for the short run and wehave a range for the long run?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.Because that's the way the Manager [operates].

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT. We run on a reserve path. What we're aimingfor is a reserve path that's built on the midpoint if you pick a rangeor the approximate point if you pick an approximate point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I hate to introduce this again, but whatwe did once was to say 4-1/2 percent--it happened to be 4-1/2[unintelligible]--and it was clear in the record, though I forget justhow, that lower was better than higher.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.But that still seems to me an instruction to theManager.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.It's an instruction to the Desk.Okay, I buythat.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. The last paragraph still has [unintelligible]but in the second [to last] paragraph the instruction is to run hisreserve [operations] so as to be consistent with growth of about 4-1/2percent.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.I think that's right.He's going to miss--maybe or probably.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But I don't really think it makes anydifference what instruction will be given to the Manager [initially].The [question] is whether or not to put people on notice that nobodyis good enough to meet [a precise] target, and we may imply that byusing a small range.
