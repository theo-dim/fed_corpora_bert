Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan
The Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report
Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate 
February 26, 1997

[SECTION]

I appreciate the opportunity to appear before this
    Committee to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual
    report on monetary policy.

[SECTION]

The performance of the U.S. economy over the past
    year has been quite favorable.  Real GDP growth picked
    up to more than three percent over the four quarters of
    1996, as the economy progressed through its sixth year
    of expansion.  Employers added more than two-and-a-half
    million workers to their payrolls in 1996, and the
    unemployment rate fell further.  Nominal wages and
    salaries have increased faster than prices, meaning
    workers have gained ground in real terms, reflecting
    the benefits of rising productivity.  Outside the food
    and energy sectors, increases in consumer prices
    actually have continued to edge lower, with core CPI
    inflation only 2-1/2 percent over the past twelve
    months.

[SECTION]

Low inflation last year was both a symptom and a
    cause of the good economy.  It was symptomatic of the
    balance and solidity of the expansion and the evident
    absence of major strains on resources.  At the same
    time, continued low levels of inflation and inflation
    expectations have been a key support for healthy
    economic performance.  They have helped to create a
    financial and economic environment conducive to strong
    capital spending and longer-range planning generally,
    and so to sustained economic expansion.  Consequently,
    the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes it is
    crucial to keep inflation contained in the near term
    and ultimately to move toward price stability.

[SECTION]

Looking ahead, the members of the FOMC expect
    inflation to remain low and the economy to grow
    appreciably further.  However, as I shall be
    discussing, the unusually good inflation performance of
    recent years seems to owe in large part to some
    temporary factors, of uncertain longevity.  Thus, the
    FOMC continues to see the distribution of inflation
    risks skewed to the upside and must remain especially
    alert to the possible emergence of imbalances in
    financial and product markets that ultimately could
    endanger the maintenance of the low-inflation
    environment.  Sustainable economic expansion for 1997
    and beyond depends on it.

[SECTION]

For some, the benign inflation outcome of 1996
    might be considered surprising, as resource utilization
    rates--particularly of labor--were in the neighborhood
    of those that historically have been associated with
    building inflation pressures.  To be sure, an
    acceleration in nominal labor compensation, especially
    its wage component, became evident over the past year.
    But the rate of pay increase still was markedly less
    than historical relationships with labor market
    conditions would have predicted.  Atypical restraint on
    compensation increases has been evident for a few years
    now and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater
    worker insecurity.  In 1991, at the bottom of the
    recession, a survey of workers at large firms by
    International Survey Research Corporation indicated
    that 25 percent feared being laid off.  In 1996,
    despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the
    tighter labor market, the same survey organization
    found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff.

[SECTION]

The reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to
    seek other employment as the labor market tightened has
    provided further evidence of such concern, as has the
    tendency toward longer labor union contracts.  For many
    decades, contracts rarely exceeded three years.  Today,
    one can point to five- and six-year contracts--contracts that are commonly characterized by an
    emphasis on job security and that involve only modest
    wage increases.  The low level of work stoppages of
    recent years also attests to concern about job
    security.

[SECTION]

Thus, the willingness of workers in recent years
    to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job
    security seems to be reasonably well documented.  The
    unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted
    even as the labor market, by all objective measures,
    tightened considerably.  One possibility may lie in the
    rapid evolution of technologies in use in the work
    place.  Technological change almost surely has been an
    important impetus behind corporate restructuring and
    downsizing.  Also, it contributes to the concern of
    workers that their job skills may become inadequate.
    No longer can one expect to obtain all of one's
    lifetime job skills with a high-school or college
    diploma.  Indeed, continuing education is perceived to
    be increasingly necessary to retain a job.  The more
    pressing need to update job skills is doubtless also a
    factor in the marked expansion of on-
    the-job training programs, especially in technical
    areas, in many of the nation's corporations.

[SECTION]

Certainly, other factors have contributed to the
    softness in compensation growth in the past few years.
    The sharp deceleration in health care costs, of course,
    is cited frequently.  Another is the heightened
    pressure on firms and their workers in industries that
    compete internationally.  Domestic deregulation has had
    similar effects on the intensity of competitive forces
    in some industries.  In any event, although I do not
    doubt that all these factors are relevant, I would be
    surprised if they were nearly as important as job
    insecurity.

[SECTION]

If heightened job insecurity is the most
    significant explanation of the break with the past in
    recent years, then it is important to recognize that,
    as I indicated in last February's Humphrey-Hawkins
    testimony, suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence
    of job insecurity can be carried only so far.  At some
    point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job
    security has to come to an end.  In other words, the
    relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a
    temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because
    there is a limit to the value of additional job
    security people are willing to acquire in exchange for
    lesser increases in living standards.  Even if real
    wages were to remain permanently on a lower upward
    track than otherwise as a result of the greater sense
    of insecurity, the rate of change of wages would revert
    at some point to a normal relationship with inflation.
    The unknown is when this transition period will end.

[SECTION]

Indeed, some recent evidence suggests that the
    labor markets bear especially careful watching for
    signs that the return to more normal patterns may be in
    process.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that
    people were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to
    seek other employment in January than previously.  The
    possibility that this reflects greater confidence by
    workers accords with a recent further rise in the
    percent of households responding to a Conference Board
    survey who perceive that job availability is plentiful.
    Of course, the job market has continued to be quite
    good recently; employment in January registered robust
    growth and initial claims for unemployment insurance
    have been at a relatively low level of late.  Wages
    rose faster in 1996 than in 1995 by most measures,
    perhaps also raising questions about whether the
    transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be
    drawing to a close.

[SECTION]

To be sure, the pickup in wage gains has not shown
    through to underlying price inflation.  Increases in
    the core CPI, as well as in several broader measures of
    prices, have stayed subdued or even edged off further
    in recent months.  As best we can judge, faster
    productivity growth last year meant that rising
    compensation gains did not cause labor costs per unit
    of output to increase any more rapidly.  Non-labor
    costs, which are roughly a quarter of total
    consolidated costs of the nonfinancial corporate
    sector, were little changed in 1996.

[SECTION]

Owing in part to this subdued behavior of unit
    costs, profits and rates of return on capital have
    risen to high levels.  As a consequence, businesses
    believe that, were they to raise prices to boost
    profits further, competitors with already ample profit
    margins would not follow suit; instead, they would use
    the occasion to capture a greater market share.  This
    interplay is doubtless a significant factor in the
    evident loss of pricing power in American business.

[SECTION]

Intensifying global competition also may be
    further restraining domestic firms' ability to hike
    prices as well as wages.  Clearly, the appreciation of
    the dollar on balance over the past eighteen months or
    so, together with low inflation in many of our trading
    partners, has resulted in a marked decline in non-oil
    import prices that has helped to damp domestic
    inflation pressures.  Yet it is important to emphasize
    that these influences, too, would be holding down
    inflation only temporarily; they represent a transition
    to a lower price level than would otherwise prevail,
    not to a permanently lower rate of inflation.

[SECTION]

Against the background of all these considerations,
    the FOMC has recognized the need to
    remain vigilant for signs of potentially inflationary
    imbalances that might, if not corrected promptly,
    undermine our economic expansion.  The FOMC in fact has
    signaled a state of heightened alert for possible
    policy tightening since last July in its policy
    directives.  But, we have also taken care not to act
    prematurely.  The FOMC refrained from changing policy
    last summer, despite expectations of a near-term policy
    firming by many financial market participants.  In
    light of the developments I've just discussed affecting
    wages and prices, we thought inflation might well
    remain damped, and in any case was unlikely to pick up
    very rapidly, in part because the economic expansion
    appeared likely to slow to a more sustainable pace.  In
    the event, inflation has remained quiescent since then.

[SECTION]

Given the lags with which monetary policy affects
    the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in
    which a preemptive policy tightening may become
    appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation
    becomes evident.  If the FOMC were to implement such an
    action, it would be judging that the risks to the
    economic expansion of waiting longer had increased
    unduly and had begun to outweigh the advantages of
    waiting for uncertainties to be reduced by the
    accumulation of more information about economic trends.
    Indeed, the hallmark of a successful policy to foster
    sustainable economic growth is that inflation does not
    rise.  I find it ironic that our actions in 1994-95
    were criticized by some because inflation did not turn
    upward.  That outcome, of course, was the intent of the
    tightening, and I am satisfied that our actions then
    were both necessary and effective, and helped to foster
    the continued economic expansion.

[SECTION]

To be sure, 1997 is not 1994.  The real federal
    funds rate today is significantly higher than it was
    three years ago.  Then we had just completed an
    extended period of monetary ease which addressed the
    credit stringencies of the early 1990s, and with the
    abatement of the credit crunch, the low real funds rate
    of early 1994 was clearly incompatible with containing
    inflation and sustaining growth going forward.  In
    February 1997, in contrast, our concern is a matter of
    relative risks rather than of expected outcomes.  The
    real funds rate, judging by core inflation, is only
    slightly below its early 1995 peak for this cycle and
    might be at a level that will promote continued non-
    inflationary growth, especially considering the recent
    rise in the exchange value of the dollar.  Nonetheless,
    we cannot be sure.  And the risks of being wrong are
    clearly tilted to the upside.

[SECTION]

I wish it were possible to lay out in advance
    exactly what conditions have to prevail to portend a
    buildup of inflation pressures or inflationary
    psychology.  However, the circumstances that have been
    associated with increasing inflation in the past have
    not followed a single pattern.  The processes have
    differed from cycle to cycle, and what may have been a
    useful leading indicator in one instance has given off
    misleading signals in another.

[SECTION]

I have already discussed the key role of labor
    market developments in restraining inflation in the
    current cycle and our careful monitoring of signs that
    the transition phase of trading off lower real wages
    for greater job security might be coming to a close.
    As always, with resource utilization rates high, we
    would need to watch closely a situation in which demand
    was clearly unsustainable because it was producing
    escalating pressures on resources, which could
    destabilize the economy.  And we would need to be
    watchful that the progress we have made in keeping
    inflation expectations damped was not eroding.  In
    general, though, our analysis will need to encompass
    all potentially relevant information, from financial
    markets as well as the economy, especially when some
    signals, like those in the labor market, have not been
    following their established patterns.

[SECTION]

The ongoing economic expansion to date has
    reinforced our conviction about the importance of low
    inflation--and the public's confidence in continued low
    inflation.  The economic expansion almost surely would
    not have lasted nearly so long had monetary policy
    supported an unsustainable acceleration of spending
    that induced a buildup of inflationary imbalances.  The
    Federal Reserve must not acquiesce in an upcreep in
    inflation, for acceding to higher inflation would
    countenance an insidious weakening of our chances for
    sustaining long-run economic growth.  Inflation
    interferes with the efficient allocation of resources
    by confusing price signals, undercutting a focus on the
    longer run, and distorting incentives.

[SECTION]

This year overall inflation is anticipated to stay
    restrained.  The central tendency of the forecasts made
    by the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents has
    the increase in the total CPI slipping back into a
    range of 2-3/4 to 3 percent over the four quarters of
    the year.  This slight falloff from last year's pace is
    expected to owe in part to a slower rise in food prices
    as some of last year's supply limitations ease.  More
    importantly, world oil supplies are projected by most
    analysts to increase relative to world oil demand, and
    futures markets project a further decline in prices, at
    least in the near term.  The recent and prospective
    declines in crude oil prices not only should affect
    retail gasoline and home heating oil prices but also
    should relieve inflation pressures through lower prices
    for other petroleum products, which are imbedded in the
    economy's underlying cost structure.  Nonetheless, the
    trend in inflation rates in the core CPI and in broader
    price measures may be somewhat less favorable than in
    recent years.  A continued tight labor market, whose
    influence on costs would be augmented by the scheduled
    increase in the minimum wage later in the year and
    perhaps by higher growth of benefits now that
    considerable health-care savings already have been
    realized, could put upward pressure on core inflation.
    Moreover, the effects of the sharp rise in the dollar
    over the last eighteen months in pushing down import
    prices are likely to ebb over coming quarters.

[SECTION]

The unemployment rate, according to Board members
    and Bank presidents, should stay around 5-1/4 to 5-1/2
    percent through the fourth quarter, consistent with
    their projections of measured real GDP growth of 2 to
    2-1/4 percent over the four quarters of the year.  Such
    a growth rate would represent some downshifting in
    output expansion from that of last year.  The projected
    moderation of growth likely would reflect several
    influences: (1) declines in real federal government
    purchases should be exerting a modest degree of
    restraint on overall demand; (2) the lagged effects of
    the increase in the exchange value of the dollar in
    recent months likely will damp U.S. net exports
    somewhat this year; and (3) residential construction is
    unlikely to repeat the gains of 1996.  On the other
    hand, we do not see evidence of widespread imbalances
    either in business inventories or in stocks of
    equipment and consumer durables that would lead to a
    substantial cutback in spending.  And financial
    conditions overall remain supportive; real interest
    rates are not high by historical standards and credit
    is readily available from intermediaries and in the
    market.

[SECTION]

The usual uncertainties in the overall outlook are
    especially focused on the behavior of consumers.
    Consumption should rise roughly in line with the
    projected moderate expansion of disposable income, but
    both upside and downside risks are present.  According
    to various surveys, sentiment is decidedly upbeat.
    Consumers have enjoyed healthy gains in their real
    incomes along with the extraordinary stock-market
    driven rise in their financial wealth over the last
    couple of years.  Indeed, econometric models suggest
    that the more than $4 trillion rise in equity values
    since late 1994 should have had a larger positive
    influence on consumer spending than seems to have
    actually occurred.

[SECTION]

It is possible, however, that households have been
    reluctant to spend much of their added wealth because
    they see a greater need to keep it to support spending
    in retirement.  Many households have expressed
    heightened concern about their financial security in
    old age, which reportedly has led to increased
    provision for retirement.  The results of a survey
    conducted annually by the Roper Organization, which
    asks individuals about their confidence in the Social
    Security system, shows that between 1992 and 1996 the
    percent of respondents expressing little or no
    confidence in the system jumped from about 45 percent
    to more than 60 percent.

[SECTION]

Moreover, consumer debt burdens are near
    historical highs, while credit card delinquencies and
    personal bankruptcies have risen sharply over the past
    year.  These circumstances may make both borrowers and
    lenders a bit more cautious, damping spending.  In fact,
    we may be seeing both wealth and debt effects already at
    work for different segments of the population, to an
    approximately offsetting extent.  Saving out of current
    income by households in the upper income quintile, who
    own nearly three-fourths of all non-pension equities
    held by households, evidently has declined in recent
    years.  At the same time, the use of credit for
    purchases appears to have leveled off after a sharp
    runup from 1993 to 1996, perhaps because some
    households are becoming debt constrained and, as a
    result, are curtailing their spending.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve will be weighing these
    influences as it endeavors to help extend the current
    period of sustained growth.  Participants in financial
    markets seem to believe that in the current benign
    environment the FOMC will succeed indefinitely.  There
    is no evidence, however, that the business cycle has
    been repealed.  Another recession will doubtless occur
    some day owing to circumstances that could not be, or
    at least were not, perceived by policymakers and
    financial market participants alike.  History
    demonstrates that participants in financial markets are
    susceptible to waves of optimism, which can in turn
    foster a general process of asset-price inflation that
    can feed through into markets for goods and services.
    Excessive optimism sows the seeds of its own reversal
    in the form of imbalances that tend to grow over time.
    When unwarranted expectations ultimately are not
    realized, the unwinding of these financial excesses can
    act to amplify a downturn in economic activity, much as
    they can amplify the upswing.  As you know, last
    December I put the question this way: "...how do we
    know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated
    asset values, which then become subject to unexpected
    and prolonged contractions ...?"

[SECTION]

We have not been able, as yet, to provide a
    satisfying answer to this question, but there are
    reasons in the current environment to keep this
    question on the table.  Clearly, when people are
    exposed to long periods of relative economic
    tranquility, they seem inevitably prone to complacency
    about the future.  This is understandable.  We have had
    fifteen years of economic expansion interrupted by only
    one recession--and that was six years ago.  As the
    memory of such past events fades, it naturally seems
    ever less sensible to keep up one's guard against an
    adverse event in the future.  Thus, it should come as
    no surprise that, after such a long period of balanced
    expansion, risk premiums for advancing funds to businesses
    in virtually all financial markets have declined to near-
    record lows.

[SECTION]

Is it possible that there is something
    fundamentally new about this current period that would
    warrant such complacency?  Yes, it is possible.
    Markets may have become more efficient,  competition is
    more global, and information technology has doubtless
    enhanced the stability of business operations.  But,
    regrettably, history is strewn with visions of such
    "new eras" that, in the end, have proven to be a
    mirage.  In short, history counsels caution.

[SECTION]

Such caution seems especially warranted with
    regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the
    past two years.  These gains have obviously raised
    questions of sustainability.  Analytically, current
    stock-price valuations at prevailing long-term interest
    rates could be justified by very strong earnings growth
    expectations.  In fact, the long-term earnings
    projections of financial analysts have been marked up
    noticeably over the last year and seem to imply very
    high earnings growth and continued rising profit
    margins, at a time when such margins are already up
    appreciably from their depressed levels of five years
    ago.  It could be argued that, although margins are the
    highest in a generation, they are still below those
    that prevailed in the 1960s.  Nonetheless, further
    increases in these margins would evidently require
    continued restraint on costs: labor compensation
    continuing to grow at its current pace and productivity
    growth picking up.  Neither, of course, can be ruled
    out.  But we should keep in mind that, at these
    relatively low long-term interest rates, small changes
    in long-term earnings expectations could have outsized
    impacts on equity prices.

[SECTION]

Caution also seems warranted by the narrow yield
    spreads that suggest perceptions of low risk, possibly
    unrealistically low risk.  Considerable optimism about
    the ability of businesses to sustain this current
    healthy financial condition seems, as I indicated
    earlier, to be influencing the setting of risk
    premiums, not just in the stock market but throughout
    the financial system.  This optimistic attitude has
    become especially evident in quality spreads on high-
    yield corporate bonds--what we used to call "junk
    bonds."  In addition, banks have continued to ease
    terms and standards on business loans, and margins on
    many of these loans are now quite thin.  Many banks are
    pulling back a little from consumer credit card lending
    as losses exceed expectations.  Nonetheless, some bank
    and nonbank lenders have been expanding aggressively
    into the home equity loan market and so-called
    "subprime" auto lending, although recent problems in
    the latter may already be introducing a sense of
    caution.

[SECTION]

Why should the central bank be concerned about the
    possibility that financial markets may be
    overestimating returns or mispricing risk?  It is not
    that we have a firm view that equity prices are
    necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads
    patently too low.  Our goal is to contribute as best we
    can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth
    over time, and we would be pleased if the favorable
    economic environment projected in markets actually
    comes to pass.  Rather, the FOMC has to be sensitive to
    indications of even slowly building imbalances,
    whatever their source, that, by fostering the emergence
    of inflation pressures, would ultimately threaten
    healthy economic expansion.

[SECTION]

Unfortunately, because the monetary aggregates
    were subject to an episode of aberrant behavioral
    patterns in the early 1990s, they are likely to be of
    only limited help in making this judgment.  For three
    decades starting in the early 1960s, the public's
    demand for the broader monetary aggregates, especially
    M2, was reasonably predictable.  In the intermediate
    term, M2 velocity--nominal income divided by the stock
    of M2--tended to vary directly with the difference
    between money market yields and the return on M2
    assets--that is, with its short-term opportunity cost.
    In the long run, as adjustments in deposit rates caused
    the opportunity cost to revert to an equilibrium, M2
    velocity also tended to return to an associated stable
    equilibrium level.  For several years in the early
    1990s, however, the velocities of M2 and M3 exhibited
    persisting upward shifts that departed markedly from
    these historical patterns.

[SECTION]

In the last two to three years, velocity patterns
    seem to have returned to those historical
    relationships, after allowing for a presumed permanent
    upward shift in the levels of velocity.  Even so, given
    the abnormal velocity behavior during the early 1990s,
    FOMC members continue to see considerable uncertainty
    in the relationship of broad money to opportunity costs
    and nominal income.  Concern about the possibility of
    aberrant behavior has made the FOMC hesitant to upgrade
    the role of these measures in monetary policy.

[SECTION]

Against this background, at its February meeting,
    the FOMC reaffirmed the provisional ranges set last
    July for money and debt growth this year:  1 to 5
    percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7
    percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors.
    The M2 and M3 ranges again are designed to be consistent 
    with the FOMC's long-run goal of price stability:
    For, if the velocities of the broader monetary
    aggregates were to continue behaving as they did before
    1990, then money growth around the middle portions of
    the ranges would be consistent with noninflationary,
    sustainable economic expansion.  But, even with such
    velocity behavior this year, when inflation is expected
    to still be higher than is consistent with our long-run
    objective of reasonable price stability, the broader

I will conclude on the same upbeat note about the
    U.S. economy with which I began.  Although a central
    banker's occupational responsibility is to stay on the
    lookout for trouble, even I must admit that our
    economic prospects in general are quite favorable.  The
    flexibility of our market system and the vibrancy of
    our private sector remain examples for the whole world
    to emulate.  The Federal Reserve will endeavor to do
    its part by continuing to foster a monetary framework
    under which our citizens can prosper to the fullest
    possible extent.
