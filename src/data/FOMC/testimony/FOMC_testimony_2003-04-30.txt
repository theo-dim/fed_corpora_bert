Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to have this opportunity 
        to update you on developments in the U.S. economy since mid-February, 
        when I presented the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report.

[SECTION]

At that time, I noted that the economic expansion over the preceding 
        year had been modest. Spending by households had contributed importantly 
        to the gains in economic activity. The nation's strong underlying productivity 
        performance was providing ongoing support for household income. That rise 
        in income, combined with low interest rates, reduced taxes, and the availability 
        of substantial home equity, had spurred solid gains in consumer spending 
        and a robust advance in residential construction.

[SECTION]

In contrast, although the contraction in capital spending appeared to 
        have slowed, we had yet to see any convincing signs that a sustained pickup 
        in business spending was emerging. Moreover, heightened geopolitical tensions 
        were adding to the already considerable uncertainties that had clouded 
        the business outlook over the preceding three years. The general climate 
        of caution in the business sector was manifest in a number of ways, including 
        restrained hiring, a reluctance to invest in new capacity, and aggressive 
        actions to maintain low levels of inventories.

[SECTION]

In late February and early March, the risks and uncertainties surrounding 
        the economic outlook intensified as the range of possibilities for the 
        timing, duration, and economic consequences of the pending war in Iraq 
        appeared to widen. In financial markets, a greater sense of caution among 
        investors seemed to bolster the demand for Treasury and other fixed-income 
        securities at the expense of equities; the price of crude oil moved up, 
        as did the prices of gasoline and home heating oil; and consumer confidence 
        sagged further. After picking up in January, payroll employment and manufacturing 
        production turned down again in February and March.

[SECTION]

When the onset of the war became imminent, financial markets rallied, 
        and the price of crude oil dropped back. Market participants seemed buoyed 
        simply by the elimination of uncertainty about the timing of the start, 
        and hence the end of hostilities, although a still-significant amount 
        of unease inevitably remained about the way the war might progress and 
        how severely it might disrupt oil production and economic activity.

[SECTION]

In such an environment, we had little ability to distinguish temporary 
        changes from more persistent shifts in underlying economic trends. For 
        that reason, the Federal Open Market Committee, at its March 18 meeting, 
        refrained from making a determination about the balance of risks with 
        respect to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic 
        growth. At the same time, we stepped up our surveillance of economic developments.

[SECTION]

As part of that surveillance, we receive virtually continuous information 
        from commodity and financial markets. The price of crude oil is now well 
        below its peak of early March, as the potential for serious supply disruptions 
        in world oil markets has diminished. Broad equity indexes remain well 
        above their lows of mid-March and have been boosted most recently by incoming 
        information on first-quarter earnings that market participants appear 
        to view as generally positive.

[SECTION]

In contrast, six weeks after the beginning of the war, we have only limited 
        readings on broader economic conditions, and that information has been 
        mixed. Households appear to have become somewhat less apprehensive about 
        the economic outlook in recent weeks, though reports from businesses have 
        not exhibited a similar improvement in tone. Consistent with this, the 
        persistent high level of new claims for unemployment insurance suggests 
        that firms may still be finding it possible to meet their customers' tepid 
        increases in demand with a leaner workforce.

[SECTION]

Going forward, some further unwinding of the economic tensions that have 
        been associated with the situation in Iraq seems likely. As that occurs, 
        the fundamental trends shaping the economic outlook should emerge more 
        clearly. As I indicated when I met with you earlier this year, I continue 
        to believe the economy is positioned to expand at a noticeably better 
        pace than it has during the past year, though the timing and the extent 
        of that improvement remains uncertain. Fundamentally, the long-run growth 
        potential of the economy remains solid. And the enhanced flexibility inherent 
        in that trend imparts resilience against shocks of the kinds that we have 
        experienced in the past few years.

[SECTION]

Unfortunately, the future path of the economy is likely to come into 
        sharper focus only gradually. In the interim, we need to remain mindful 
        of the possibility that lingering business caution could be an impediment 
        to improved economic performance.

[SECTION]

As you may know, the consensus of economic forecasters is that a material 
        rebound in economic activity will develop in the second half of this year, 
        and certainly a number of elements should be working in that direction. 
        The recent improvements in financial markets that I noted earlier, if 
        maintained, would seem to suggest a turnaround in capital spending. In 
        this regard, the ongoing decline in risk spreads in corporate bond markets 
        so far this year is an encouraging development. To be sure, spreads remain 
        high by historical standards, but the constraint imposed by last fall's 
        huge run-up in risk premiums now appears to have been put largely behind 
        us.

[SECTION]

In addition, businesses should see some relief from the pressure on profit 
        margins that had developed in recent months as energy prices rose sharply, 
        and improvement on this front could be a positive development for capital 
        spending. A modestly encouraging sign is provided by the backlog of orders 
        for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, which has been moving 
        up in recent months. Households, too, are likely to welcome lower energy 
        bills and a continuation of favorable conditions in mortgage and credit 
        markets.

[SECTION]

As you know, core prices by many measures have increased very slowly 
        over the last six months. With price inflation already at a low level, 
        substantial further disinflation would be an unwelcome development, especially 
        to the extent it put pressure on profit margins and impeded the revival 
        of business spending.

[SECTION]

The balance of influences on inflation and economic activity will be 
        among the subjects of discussion by the Federal Open Market Committee 
        when it meets in six days.
