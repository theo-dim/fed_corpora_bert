Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
the opportunity to speak today on matters relating to the informal U.S.-EU
Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue. I would like to focus my remarks on the
Dialogue's role in helping us to monitor European-wide regulatory developments
in financial services and understand the effects on U.S. banking organizations
operating in the European Union.

[SECTION]

Background to the DialogueAs has been noted, the
Dialogue was initiated by the Treasury Department in 2002, at a time of
significant regulatory developments in both the European Union and in the United States. At that time, the European Union was continuing its efforts, begun in 1999,
to establish a single market in financial services by implementing the "Financial
Services Action Plan" (FSAP). The FSAP consists of a number of regulatory
and legislative measures designed to achieve, among other things, a single
wholesale European market; open and secure retail markets; and state-of-the-art
prudential rules and supervision. On our side of the Atlantic, U.S. regulators were continuing to implement provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
Congress was considering reforms that led to the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. These developments, which affected European financial services firms with
  U.S. operations, naturally were of interest to staff of the European
Commission.

[SECTION]

From the outset, the
Dialogue's purpose has been to foster a better mutual understanding of U.S. and EU regulatory approaches and to identify potential substantive conflicts in
approach as early in the regulatory process as possible. The Dialogue consists
of an informal discussion or explanation of regulatory approaches,
developments, and timetables, conducted at an experts level. This format has
served us well during the past two years. Although the Federal Reserve has
regular contact with staff of the European Commission in other groups on a
range of issues, the Dialogue is the only venue dedicated specifically to U.S.-EU
regulatory issues.

[SECTION]

Federal Reserve's Interest in
Monitoring Foreign Regulatory Developments
As the umbrella
supervisor of U.S. bank holding companies and financial holding companies, the
Federal Reserve has a strong interest in the regulatory environments in which
these firms operate outside the United States. We have an established program
of working with foreign supervisors at both bilateral and multilateral levels.
Through regular contact, we track changes to foreign bank regulatory and
supervisory systems and seek to understand how these systems affect the banking
institutions we supervise.

[SECTION]

This is especially
important in the European Union, where U.S. banking organizations have
substantial operations. As of September 30, 2003, thirty-four U.S. banking organizations operated in the European Union with aggregate EU assets of more
than $747 billion. As of December 31, 2003, sixty-eight EU banking organizations maintained active banking
operations in the United States, with total third-party banking assets in their U.S. offices of $937 billion. As
these figures suggest, institutions from the United States and the EU are major
participants in each other's markets.

[SECTION]

The Dialogue as an Additional Forum
for Monitoring EU Regulatory Developments
As the EU seeks
increasingly to harmonize financial services rules across its internal market,
the regulatory role of the European Commission has grown correspondingly. In
this environment, the Dialogue complements the Federal Reserve's ongoing
relationships and discussions with EU national regulators.

[SECTION]

The Dialogue, moreover, fills
a role not presently served by any one of those ongoing relationships and
discussions. As the market for financial services becomes increasingly
integrated, the interests of banking, securities, and insurance regulators
correspondingly are becoming more common and intertwined. The Dialogue
provides a forum for discussion of issues in each of these areas. The
regulatory discussions benefit from this sharing of different substantive
perspectives. For this reason, too, the Dialogue is an efficient forum for
information exchange, which has great utility for supervisors of large complex
financial services organizations.

[SECTION]

Global companies operate
across many countries and must adapt their business and strategy to local
regulatory and supervisory requirements. It is now generally accepted in the
U.S. and internationally that a foreign firm that conducts business in a local
market should receive national treatment, that is, the foreign firm should be
treated no less favorably than a domestic firm operating in like
circumstances. The United States adopted a specific policy of national
treatment for foreign banks operating in this country with the enactment of the
International Banking Act of 1978.

[SECTION]

As we have previously
testified, implementing a policy of national treatment can be challenging.
Although large financial services companies operate in a globalized world, each
is based in a specific country whose economic regulation or supervisory
approach will differ from those in other countries. The challenge of providing
national treatment arises as we seek to adapt our own regulatory system to a
foreign banking organization that operates under a different legal and
regulatory structure. We believe the Federal Reserve has successfully met the
challenge in its treatment of foreign banking organizations operating in this
country. Part of that success can be attributed to our work with foreign
regulators and supervisors in seeking to understand the operating environment
of the foreign banks we regulate. The Dialogue contributes to that knowledge.

[SECTION]

We are equally concerned
that U.S. banking organizations receive national treatment in their foreign
operations. The Dialogue provides us the best opportunity to understand EU
directives that affect those operations and provides us with the ability to
raise concerns directly with the staff that has responsibility for the
preparation and presentation of such directives.

[SECTION]

The Dialogue provides a
useful forum for information exchange between U.S. regulators and the European
Union over Europe-wide matters that have the potential to affect the application
of national treatment in particular situations. In implementing the FSAP in the European Union, the
European Union has an obligation
to ensure that the rules adopted are consistent with the principle of national
treatment. It is our expectation that the European Commission and the member
states will continue to seek to do so.

[SECTION]

Select Issues Discussed During the
Dialogue
The Dialogue has touched
on a variety of issues in the past two years. Of particular interest to the
Federal Reserve and to U.S. banking organizations operating in the EU is the
issue of the application
of the EU's Financial Conglomerates Directive to U.S. financial firms. This
Directive, and others that have been amended in connection with its adoption,
establishes various supervisory requirements for EU firms. Among other
matters, it requires that the consolidated group be subject to supervision and
minimum capital standards by a member state authority. For firms that are
headquartered outside the EU, such as U.S. banking organizations, the
directives require that the foreign financial firm operating in EU markets must
be subject to supervision at the holding company level by a competent home
country authority, which supervision is equivalent to that provided for by the
provisions of the Directive.

[SECTION]

The EU's national
supervisors will be responsible for making equivalency determinations on a
group-by-group basis, in accordance with guidance issued by the European
Commission. In the absence of an equivalence determination, U.S. financial firms with EU operations could be subject to higher capital and risk control
requirements or be required to create an EU sub-holding company.

[SECTION]

The European Commission
is preparing guidance on what might constitute equivalent supervision by third
countries. In preparing this guidance, committees working under the auspices
of the Commission convened a technical group comprised of member state
supervisors to provide input on issues to be taken into account in verifying
equivalence. The group sent questionnaires to home country supervisors of
financial organizations having operations in the EU, inquiring about the
measures those supervisors take to ensure that the entities they supervise are
subject to consolidated supervision at the top-tier level. The Federal Reserve
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prepared a joint response on
supervision of U.S. banking organizations with EU operations. We understand
that the EC's guidance is expected to be issued in the summer.

[SECTION]

Member state lead
regulators are expected to rely on the European Commission's guidance in
verifying equivalent supervision with respect to individual institutions. We
anticipate that the European Commission will keep us informed of member states'
progress in this regard during the Dialogue and also will alert us to the
existence of and procedures for addressing any disparities in member states'
approaches. We fully expect that U.S. banking organizations will be found to
meet the supervision standard of the directive.

[SECTION]

Another topic of discussion relating
to banks has been the status of work on revisions to the Basel Capital Accord
(Basel II). The discussions within the Dialogue have not focused on technical
issues that have been under consideration within the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (Basel Committee), but rather have addressed the scope of
application and implementation and timing concerns. Specifically, the Dialogue
has served as a useful venue for both the EU representatives and the Federal
Reserve participants to gain a better understanding of the implementation
procedures that are anticipated to be applicable in each jurisdiction. Staff
has been able to ask questions about the EU legislative process, and to explain
in detail how the U.S. regulatory process functions. Understanding the
requirements and limitations of each others' legislative and regulatory
processes has helped both sides achieve, in my view, a better sense of the
implementation challenges we all face and of the commitment to see the process
through.

[SECTION]

With regard to the scope of
application of the proposed new Accord, the Federal Reserve representatives
were able to provide information for the EU participants about the reasons the U.S. banking agencies proposed to require only a core set of banks to apply the advanced
approaches for both credit risk and operational risk. As you know, one of the
primary drivers behind this decision was the U.S. banking agencies' collective
view that complex, sophisticated organizations should be using the most
advanced risk measurement and management practices available and those
techniques and practices are recognized in the Basel II advanced approaches.
The U.S. agencies also proposed permitting other institutions to move
voluntarily to the advanced approaches subject to the same rigorous risk
measurement and management requirements as core banks. Through the Dialogue,
the participants were able to discuss the U.S. approach and to compare it with
the EU proposal to apply Basel II to all of its banks and investment
companies. These different implementation strategies will raise some issues,
and that is why the Basel Committee has created the Accord Implementation Group
to coordinate implementation across jurisdictions and work through home-host
issues.

[SECTION]

As
noted, issues are not resolved during Dialogue discussions; that is not the
purpose of the Dialogue. But open communication that fosters understanding can
feed back into the decision-making discussions when they are held in other
appropriate forums. With respect to Basel II implementation and the Dialogue,
in my view, the current structure will continue to serve a useful purpose--as
implementation issues are identified, the Dialogue can be a venue for candid,
informal communication. Participants can take back to their constituents the
results of those discussions and the subject matter experts can determine how
best to address issues that are raised or respond to particular questions or
concerns.

[SECTION]

The Dialogue has been useful in diffusing
tensions over matters that have a direct impact on global firms. This has been
especially true with respect to issues under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a
discussion of which I shall leave to my SEC colleague. The Dialogue has also
been helpful on less high profile matters. Through discussions at Dialogue
meetings, we were able to keep EC staff apprised of developments relating to
asset pledge requirements applicable to foreign banking organizations having U.S. offices.

[SECTION]

For more than forty years, federal and state bank licensing authorities
have imposed an asset pledge or capital equivalency deposit requirement on U.S. branches and agencies of international banks, primarily for safety and soundness
reasons. This requirement obligated such institutions to hold certain
negotiable securities at American custodian banks. In recent years, foreign
banks were of the view that such requirements were more onerous than necessary
and sought a reduction in the level of assets to be pledged. The matter was
brought to the attention of European Commission staff who raised it at the
Dialogue. We were able to inform Commission staff of progress being made on
this front by state authorities in New York and elsewhere over a two-year
period. New York changed its asset pledge requirement in 2003, generally satisfying
the concerns of foreign banks. The Dialogue was a useful forum to keep
Commission staff apprised of developments during this period.

[SECTION]

International AccountingThe FSAP also contemplates mandating
adherence to international accounting standards. Currently, banking
organizations in the European Union may prepare their annual financial
statements in accordance with the accounting standards of the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB), U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.
GAAP), and/or national standards. The use of U.S. GAAP is usually limited to
those banking organizations or other companies whose securities are publicly
traded on U.S. stock exchanges and are registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In many cases, these companies will also provide separate
financial statements based on their national accounting standards and
disclosure rules. The European Union will require all EU companies listed on
EU exchanges that are currently following national standards to follow IASB
standards by 2005 and will require those EU companies that currently follow
U.S. GAAP to adopt IASB standards by 2007. The EU is also working to adopt
international auditing standards for external audits of EU companies, including
banks.

[SECTION]

The
IASB is now independent of the international accounting profession and
independently funded. It has adopted many of the structural elements of the FASB
in the United States, which are intended to promote an independent, objective
standards-setting environment. Many senior American accounting experts serve on
the IASB and its staff. IASB GAAP has many similarities with U.S. GAAP and the
IASB issued extensive enhancements to its standards last year and this year,
with additional improvements also issued as a proposal this year. For example,
in recent months the IASB issued major revisions to its standards for financial
instruments, which are similar to U.S. GAAP and cover many areas of banking
activities. One aspect of these revisions by the IASB significantly improved
the guidance on loan loss allowances in ways that could lead to better bank
reserving practices around the world.

[SECTION]

The
Federal Reserve has long supported sound accounting policies and meaningful
public disclosure by banking and financial organizations with the objective of
improving market discipline and fostering stable financial markets. The
concept of market discipline is assuming greater importance among international
banking supervisors as well. Basel II seeks to strengthen the market's ability
to aid bank supervisors in evaluating banking organizations' risks and
assessing capital adequacy. It consists of three pillars, or tools: a minimum
risk-based capital requirement (pillar I), risk-based supervision (pillar II),
and disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline
(pillar III). This approach to capital regulation, with its market-discipline
component, signals that sound accounting and disclosure will continue to be
important aspects of our supervisory approach.

[SECTION]

The
Federal Reserve and the other U.S. banking agencies are also actively involved
in the efforts of the Basel Committee to promote sound international
accounting, auditing, and disclosure standards and practices for global banking
organizations and other companies. For example, an official of the Federal
Reserve Board is a member of the Standards Advisory Council that advises the
IASB and its trustees on IASB projects, proposals and standards. The U.S. banking agencies have been active in supporting the Basel Committee in its work with
the IASB's technical advisory groups to enhance the IASB's standards for
financial instruments and bank disclosures. The Federal Reserve Board has also
been active in supporting the Basel Committee's projects with the International
Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and other international regulatory
organizations, such as International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO), to promote substantial enhancements to global standards and practices
for audits of banks and other companies.

[SECTION]

Although
the Federal Reserve Board has been actively involved in addressing international
accounting and auditing issues primarily through our involvement in the Basel
Committee's projects, the Securities and Exchange Commission has had the
primary role in discussing these matters with the EU representatives as part of
the Dialogue.

[SECTION]

Cooperation on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist
Financing Issues
While not historically part of the
U.S.-EU Dialogue, recent anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing
regulatory initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic have had a significant
impact on banking organizations, many of which operate globally. Because of
the potential consequences of differences in regulatory approaches in this
area, governments have been in frequent contact. In the end, the anti-money
laundering provisions set forth in the USA PATRIOT Act and those contained
in the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive are generally in harmony.

[SECTION]

Part of this can be attributed to the
Federal Reserve's and other U.S. and EU regulatory authorities' mutual
involvement in multilateral policy efforts to improve regulatory systems so to
prevent these crimes, such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel
Committee's cross-border banking group. On a practical level, supervisory
dialogue and cooperation on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
financing also has been necessary due to the role the Federal Reserve
frequently shares with its EU counterparts as "home/host" supervisors
of global banking organizations. However, this cooperation is typically
focused on providing assistance in order to fulfill supervisory mandates, not
to conduct money laundering or terrorist financing investigations, the
authority for which typically falls with law enforcement authorities.

[SECTION]

While Bank Secrecy Act requirements,
including the provisions added by the USA PATRIOT Act, generally do not
extend to foreign operations of U.S. banking organizations, the Federal Reserve
is interested in understanding the global operations of the banking
organizations under Federal Reserve supervision as a matter of safety and
soundness. In this regard, the Federal Reserve relies upon communication with
supervisors from foreign jurisdictions, including EU member states, in which
banking organizations subject to Federal Reserve supervision have material
operations.

[SECTION]

Critical information obtained in the
course of an examination, which may impact a banking organization's operations
in the foreign jurisdiction, is typically exchanged among relevant
supervisors. For example, when a Federal Reserve Bank conducts an on-site
examination of a foreign banking organization in the United States, and
significant problems are identified with regard to its anti-money laundering
program, the Federal Reserve contacts the home country supervisor to discuss
the findings and to develop corrective action plans.

[SECTION]

Moreover, the Federal Reserve may
provide information to European Union member bank supervisors when
administrative penalties have been imposed or any other formal enforcement
action has been taken against a U.S. banking organization (whether or not it is
related to anti-money laundering requirements) if the Federal Reserve believes
such information will be important to the host country supervisor. The Federal
Reserve expects the same from its counterparts.

[SECTION]

Future of the Dialogue
As is evident from the tenor of my remarks, the
Federal Reserve has found the Dialogue to be a useful vehicle for monitoring
the rapid regulatory developments in the European Union and exchanging
information. We are committed to continuing discussions with the Commission on
matters of mutual interest, both bilaterally and as part of the financial
markets regulatory discussions led by the Treasury Department. The regulatory
landscape in the European Union is certain to continue to develop rapidly in
the coming years, particularly with expansion of the European Union, member
states' implementation of the numerous FSAP measures needed to create a single
market for financial services, and the growing integration of our capital
markets.

[SECTION]

We at the Federal Reserve have an obligation to
keep apprised of these developments on a timely basis in order to fulfill our
supervisory function and to ensure a level playing field for U.S. banking organizations operating in the European Union. We are confident that
continuing the Dialogue in its present form would facilitate these objectives.

[SECTION]

We are equally confident that other existing
multilateral and bilateral exchange mechanisms are appropriate venues for
discussing policies and attempting to resolve disputes. In our view,
formalizing the Dialogue--for example, by elevating it to the principals level
or expanding its mandate to include policy-setting or dispute resolution
functions--would be unnecessary and may impair the Dialogue's utility.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve believes that U.S. banks are second to none in their ability to compete when they are given the
opportunity of operating on a level playing field. Providing strong
supervision at home and participating in international regulatory and
supervisory groups such as the Dialogue helps assure that our banking
organizations will continue to have such opportunities.
