Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee on Banking, 
        Housing, and Urban Affairs, I thank you for the opportunity to join my 
        colleagues from the other federal banking agencies to discuss the current 
        status of Basel II in this country, as well as the status of proposed 
        amendments to our existing Basel I-based capital rules.

[SECTION]

Introduction
        The Federal Reserve considers the maintenance of strong and stable financial 
        markets as an integral part of our responsibility and critically related 
        to safety and soundness of the participants in those markets. Financial 
        stability contributes to sustained economic growth by providing an environment 
        in which financial institutions, businesses, and households can conduct 
        their business with more certainty about future outcomes. Part of maintaining 
        a strong financial system is ensuring that banking organizations operate 
        in a safe and sound manner with adequate capital cushions that appropriately 
        support the risks they take.

[SECTION]

As many of you are aware, there have been two major developments within 
        the past six weeks regarding U.S. regulatory capital requirements that 
        apply to banking institutions. First, on September 30, the U.S. banking 
        agencies announced their revised plan for the implementation of the Basel 
        II framework in the United States. Second, the agencies published for 
        comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) pertaining to 
        amendments to the existing Basel I-based capital rules (the amended Basel 
        I). Taken together, these proposals on Basel II and the amended Basel 
        I represent substantial revisions to the regulatory risk-based capital 
        rules applied to U.S. banking institutions, from the very largest to the 
        smallest. From the Federal Reserve's perspective, these two initiatives, 
        when implemented successfully, should produce a much-improved regulatory 
        capital regime in the United States that enhances safety and soundness. 
        The Federal Reserve considers the ongoing discussion between the Congress 
        and the U.S. banking agencies--and, of course, with the banking industry 
        and members of the public--to be critical to the success of both sets 
        of proposals.

[SECTION]

Reasons for Pursuing Basel II
        We have all witnessed the substantial changes in the U.S. banking industry 
        over the past decade, including growth in size and geographic scope, expansion 
        of activities, development of new instruments and services, and greater 
        use of technology. As a result, we have seen the rise of very large entities 
        with large geographic reach operating in many lines of business and engaging 
        in complex and sophisticated transactions. The largest institutions have 
        moved away from the traditional banking strategy of holding assets on 
        the balance sheet to strategies that emphasize redistribution of assets 
        and actively managing risks. These dramatic changes to the risk profiles 
        of many banking organizations have only accelerated with the continued 
        evolution of many, often complex, financial tools, such as securtitizations 
        and credit derivatives.

[SECTION]

Additionally, risk-management techniques employed by many banking organizations 
        continue to change, improve, and adapt to the ever-changing financial landscape. 
        For instance, operational risk was not part of our risk-management thinking 
        ten years ago, but tools to identify, measure, and manage it are now becoming 
        prevalent. Also, the lines between the banking book and the trading book 
        have blurred significantly and organizations continue to move resources 
        and products to optimize earnings and manage risks. And finally, global 
        competition has intensified significantly, as the ability of customers 
        to choose from a variety of local and international banking firms, as 
        well as nonbank competitors, has increased.

[SECTION]

While the current Basel I-based rules have served us well for nearly 
        two decades, they are simply not appropriate for identifying and measuring 
        the risks of our largest, most complex banking organizations. Basel I, 
        even when periodically amended, must be straightforward enough for even 
        the smallest banking organizations to implement with relative ease. Thus, 
        the categories of risk used to determine capital are very broad and are 
        intended to capture the "average" risk levels across the banking 
        system for that generic exposure.

[SECTION]

Large financial institutions, however, tend to manage risk in more proactive 
        ways, and are able to take advantage of new innovations in financial instruments 
        to hedge, sell, or take on risk exposures to support their business strategies 
        and profitability targets. As a result, they are able to remove balance 
        sheet exposures for risks where they feel regulatory capital is set too 
        high, and thereby reduce minimum regulatory capital. Smaller organizations 
        generally do not have the risk-management systems or scale of transactions 
        to make these practices economically viable.

[SECTION]

While the balance sheet focus of Basel I is appropriate for most banking 
        organizations, the largest organizations have significant exposures off 
        the books, and these risk exposures need to be considered explicitly in 
        determining minimum regulatory capital for these sophisticated organizations. 
        Large organizations are increasingly gravitating toward fee-based revenue 
        streams. This is due to securitizations of loan portfolios that retain 
        the responsibility of servicing the loans, buying and selling financial 
        instruments for customers, and growth in business lines where fees are 
        generated by transactions and account processing. These activities have 
        little exposure shown on the balance sheet at a moment in time, but failure 
        to operate complex systems and negotiate complex financial deals in a 
        sound manner can lead to large loss exposures given the volume of activity 
        that runs through the line of business. They also use sophisticated models 
        to manage credit, market, and interest rate risks. Poor data integrity, 
        model reliability or lack of sufficient controls, can create losses when 
        management action relies on the faulty results of decision models.

[SECTION]

Finally, the complexity of these organizations makes it more difficult 
        for executive management to view risk in a comprehensive way, both in 
        terms of aggregating similar and correlated risks, but also in identifying 
        potential conflicts of interest between the growth of a line of business 
        and the reputation, legal, and compliance risks of the firm as a whole. 
        In recent years, large financial institutions have reported losses from 
        breaks in these operating controls that in some cases have exceeded those 
        in credit or market risk.

[SECTION]

The Basel II framework should improve supervisors' ability to understand 
        and monitor the risk taking and capital adequacy of large complex institutions, 
        thereby allowing regulators to address emerging problems more proactively. 
        It should also enhance the ability of market participants, through public 
        disclosures, to evaluate the risk positions at those institutions by providing 
        much better risk measures. The advanced approaches under Basel II, which 
        include the advanced internal ratings-based approach (or A-IRB) for credit 
        risk and the advanced measurement approaches (or AMA) for operational 
        risk, offer particularly good improvements in terms of risk sensitivity, 
        since they incorporate advanced risk-management processes already used 
        today by best-practice institutions.

[SECTION]

Indeed, the expected improvements in risk measurement and risk management 
        form the core of our reasons for proposing Basel II in the United States. 
        Its advanced approaches create a rational link between regulatory capital 
        and risk management. Under these approaches, institutions would be required 
        to adopt a set of quantitative risk-measurement and sophisticated risk-management 
        procedures and processes. For instance, Basel II establishes standards 
        for data collection and the systematic use of the information collected. 
        These standards are consistent with broader supervisory expectations that 
        high-quality risk management at large complex organizations depends upon 
        credible data. Enhancements to technological infrastructure--combined 
        with detailed data--will, over time, allow firms to better track exposures 
        and manage risk. The emphasis in Basel II on improved data standards should 
        not be interpreted solely as a requirement to determine regulatory capital 
        standards, but rather as a foundation for more advanced risk-management 
        practices that would strengthen the value of the banking franchise. But 
        while the new framework would, in our view, provide useful incentives 
        for institutions to accelerate the improvement of risk management, we 
        believe that in most areas of risk management institutions would continue 
        to have the choice among which methods they employ.

[SECTION]

Thus, from a safety and soundness regulatory perspective, for these 
        large, complex financial organizations, regulators and market participants 
        need the information provided by the advanced framework of Basel II.

[SECTION]

Recent Developments with Basel II
        The Federal Reserve considers the agencies' September 30 announcement 
        relating to Basel II a good outcome and an example of successful interagency 
        cooperation. As you may recall, in April of this year the agencies announced 
        jointly their reaction to initial results of a fourth quantitative impact 
        study pertaining to Basel II, known as QIS4. As the April statement indicated, 
        we were concerned about results from QIS4 that showed a wider dispersion 
        and a larger overall drop in minimum regulatory capital requirements for 
        the QIS4 population of institutions than the agencies had initially expected. 
        The initial QIS4 results prompted the agencies to delay issuance of a 
        notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for Basel II in order to conduct further 
        analysis of those results and their potential impact. The agencies' reaction 
        to the initial QIS4 results, deciding to take additional time to understand 
        more fully the information provided by the QIS4 institutions, is an indicator 
        of how seriously we are taking Basel II implementation.

[SECTION]

During the summer, the U.S. agencies conducted additional analysis of 
        the information reported in QIS4. That analysis is for the most part complete. 
        Based on the new knowledge gained from the additional QIS4 analysis, the 
        U.S. agencies collectively decided to move ahead with an NPR but adjust 
        the plan for U.S. implementation of Basel II. Adjustments to the plan 
        include extending the timeline for implementation and augmenting the transitional 
        floors, which should provide bankers and regulators with more experience 
        with Basel II before it is fully implemented in the United States. In 
        addition, the agencies stated specifically in our joint press release 
        that after completing a final rule for Basel II, we intend to revisit 
        that rule prior to the termination of the transitional floors. That is, 
        we expect to perform additional in-depth analyses of the Basel II minimum 
        capital calculations produced by institutions during the parallel run 
        and transitional floor periods before we move to full implementation without 
        floors. This is consistent with the overall process we have laid out for 
        implementing Basel II. We want to ensure that the minimum regulatory capital 
        levels for each institution and in the aggregate for the group of Basel 
        II banks provide an adequate capital cushion consistent with safety and 
        soundness.

[SECTION]

Probably the most important thing we learned from the QIS4 analysis 
        is that progress is being made toward developing a risk-sensitive capital 
        system. In terms of the specifics of the analysis, we learned that the 
        drop in QIS4 capital was largely due to the favorable point in the business 
        cycle when the data were collected. While the previous QIS3 exercise was 
        conducted with data from 2002, a higher credit loss year, QIS4 reflected 
        asset portfolio, risk-management information and models during one of 
        the best periods of credit quality in recent years. We learned that the 
        dispersion was largely due to varying risk parameters used by the institutions, 
        which was permissible in the QIS4 exercise, but also due to portfolio 
        differences. That is, banks have different approaches to risk-management 
        processes, and their models and databases reflect those differences.

[SECTION]

We also learned that some of the data submitted by individual institutions 
        was not complete; in some cases banks did not have estimates of loss in 
        stress periods--or used estimates that we thought were not very sophisticated--which 
        caused minimum regulatory capital to be underestimated. Based on the results 
        of QIS4, the Federal Reserve recognizes that all institutions have additional 
        work to do. In our view, the findings did not point to insurmountable 
        problems, but instead identified areas for future supervisory focus. In 
        that way, the analysis was critical in providing comfort to enable us 
        to move forward.

[SECTION]

It is also helpful to remember that the QIS4 exercise was conducted 
        on a best-efforts basis. It was just one step in a progression of events 
        leading to adoption of the Basel II framework. We certainly expect that 
        as we move closer to implementation, supervisory oversight of the Basel 
        II implementation methodologies by our examination teams would increase. 
        Indeed, during the qualification process we expect to have several additional 
        opportunities to evaluate institutions' risk-management processes, 
        models, and estimates--and provide feedback to the institutions on their 
        progress. So while the QIS4 results clearly provided a much better sense 
        than before of the progress in implementing Basel II and offered additional 
        insights about the link between risks and capital, QIS4 should not be 
        considered a complete forecast of Basel II's ultimate effects. It 
        was a point-in-time look at how the U.S. implementation was progressing.

[SECTION]

Institutions participating in QIS4 put a lot of time and effort into 
        assisting with the QIS4 analysis. For that reason, we owe it to the institutions 
        to provide feedback prior to engaging in a detailed public discussion 
        of the findings. Those feedback sessions, a full interagency effort involving 
        an interagency agreed-upon presentation of the results, are now underway 
        and we expect them to be largely completed by the end of this month. The 
        agencies plan to release a public document describing our findings shortly 
        after these sessions are completed, we hope by the end of the year.

[SECTION]

Proposed Next Steps in the Basel II Process
        I would now like to describe some possible next steps in the Basel II 
        process. To be clear, these thoughts represent our best estimates at this 
        time and could change, given the extensive opportunity for public comment 
        and additional interagency discussions to come. But I thought it would 
        at least be helpful to offer the Federal Reserve's perspective.

[SECTION]

First, we support the idea of finishing an NPR on Basel II and related 
        supervisory guidance as soon as possible, which right now looks to be 
        in the first quarter of 2006. We believe that the best way to further 
        augment our understanding of the impact of Basel II is to issue the NPR 
        and hear reaction from the Congress, the industry, and the public. In 
        addition, we are interested in issuing the NPR and related supervisory 
        guidance as soon as possible so that bankers can have a better idea of 
        supervisory expectations relating to Basel II. The NPR will help bankers 
        identify the areas where they need to strengthen their risk-measurement 
        processes as they continue to prepare for adoption of Basel II.

[SECTION]

After the end of the NPR comment period, the agencies plan to review 
        the comments and decide more specifically on how to move forward. The 
        agencies would then develop a strategy for issuing a final rule on Basel 
        II, of course taking into account comments received. Once the final rule 
        is issued, those institutions moving to Basel II would complete preparations 
        to move to a parallel run, a period in which minimum regulatory capital 
        measures under both Basel II and Basel I will be calculated. Under the 
        current timeline, the parallel run would start in January 2008.

[SECTION]

The parallel run period, which is intended to last for four continuous 
        quarters, should provide us with additional key information about the 
        expected results for Basel II on a bank-by-bank basis, as well as the 
        level of bank preparedness to operate under Basel II. Once an institution 
        conducts a successful parallel run, the relevant primary federal supervisor 
        would then confirm the bank's readiness and give permission for 
        the institution to move to the first initial phase of adoption, into the 
        initial floor period. It is only after an institution has operated to 
        the primary supervisor's satisfaction in the parallel run and each 
        of the three years of floors that it would be allowed to have its minimum 
        regulatory capital requirements determined by Basel II with no floors.

[SECTION]

During U.S. implementation of Basel II, if at any stage in the process 
        we see something that concerns the banking agencies, we will reassess 
        and propose amendments to relevant parts of the framework. The agencies 
        have already decided to embed in the planned timeline the possibility 
        for a later revision to the initial Basel II rule (before the floors are 
        removed), since it is expected that new information provided in the parallel 
        run and floor years might point to a need for adjustments to that initial 
        rule. This is entirely consistent with the path we have taken in the past 
        regarding Basel I, to which there have been more than twenty-five revisions 
        since 1989. The Federal Reserve considers all of the planned safeguards 
        and checks and balances to be sufficient for Basel II to be implemented 
        in the United States effectively, and with no negative impact on safety 
        and soundness or the functioning of banking markets. 

Proposed Amendments to Basel I
        As I noted, the Basel II proposal is not the only minimum regulatory capital 
        proposal being contemplated by the U.S. banking agencies. We have issued 
        an ANPR for amendments to Basel I that is another important initiative 
        in our efforts to update regulatory capital rules. The regulatory capital 
        rules to be amended by the ANPR would apply to thousands of banking institutions 
        in the United States, while the Basel II proposal would likely only apply 
        to ten to twenty at inception. The agencies are focusing considerable 
        attention on the potential interplay between the proposed Basel II rules 
        and the proposed Basel I amendments in order to ensure that the goals 
        for each are achieved.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve's statement pertaining to the release of the 
        ANPR highlighted that the revisions are intended to align risk-based capital 
        requirements more closely with the risk inherent in various exposures. 
        The ANPR relates, in part, to some long-standing issues in our current 
        capital rules that have been identified (such as requiring capital for 
        short-term commitments). We also noted that the amended Basel I is intended 
        to mitigate certain competitive inequalities that may arise from the implementation 
        of Basel II rules (such as lowering the risk weight for some residential 
        mortgage exposures). In considering these possible revisions, the U.S. 
        agencies are seeking to enhance the evaluation of bank portfolios and 
        their inherent risks without undue complexity or regulatory burden. In 
        issuing the ANPR, an advance notice, the agencies are emphasizing that 
        views are still being developed and additional comment from the banking 
        industry and other interested parties would be both beneficial and welcome 
        before we move forward. We are intentionally leaving a number of areas 
        open in order to solicit a broad range of comments before we narrow down 
        the range of possibilities.

[SECTION]

The U.S. banking agencies have identified over the past several years 
        a number of issues that need to be addressed within our current Basel 
        I rules. The development of Basel II-based rules also creates the need 
        for the U.S. agencies to amend the current rules in order to address issues 
        relating to competitive impact. While we view that impact as limited, 
        we want to ensure that institutions not moving to Basel II have equal 
        opportunities to pursue business initiatives and are not placed at a competitive 
        disadvantage or otherwise adversely affected. That is why we are being 
        very careful to analyze the potential results of these two efforts in 
        tandem, and asking for the Congress, the industry, and others to provide 
        comments on the potential effects of both initiatives.

[SECTION]

We believe that the revisions to Basel I-based rules should benefit 
        most institutions by better reflecting current risk exposures in regulatory 
        capital requirements at little additional burden. Naturally, regulatory 
        capital requirements are usually not the binding constraint for banking 
        organizations. Nearly all institutions hold capital in excess of the minimum 
        required regulatory ratios, in many cases several percentage points above, 
        to satisfy rating agencies, debtholders and shareholders, and counterparties 
        in the market. By the same token, pricing in the banking industry is not 
        driven by regulatory capital, but rather, as most would intuitively assume, 
        by supply and demand and business decisions made by bankers. But we think 
        regulatory capital can act as a useful gauge of risk-taking, even though 
        it would not be the deciding factor in business decisions.

[SECTION]

With respect to the proposals for amended Basel I, as well as Basel 
        II, the Federal Reserve fully supports retention of the existing prompt 
        corrective action (PCA) regime, which the Congress put in place more than 
        a decade ago, as well as existing leverage requirements. In addition to 
        the safeguards planned for initiatives being discussed today, we at the 
        Federal Reserve take comfort that the PCA and leverage requirements will 
        continue to provide a level of protection for depositors, consumers, and 
        the financial system as a whole. These regulations help to ensure a minimum 
        level of capital at individual institutions and in the aggregate that 
        we consider to be absolutely vital to the health of our banking system 
        and the economy more broadly.

[SECTION]

Importance of the Rulemaking Process
        At the Federal Reserve--indeed, I think I can say among all the U.S. banking 
        agencies--we understand and respect the rulemaking process and the legal 
        requirements for implementing regulatory revisions. This, of course, includes 
        comment periods for each of our regulatory capital proposals and transparency 
        in our overall process. We encourage a healthy debate about the agencies' 
        proposed initiatives--including the recently revised timeline for Basel 
        II. We look forward to continuing to engage the industry, the Congress, 
        fellow supervisors, and others in a discussion about what effects the 
        Basel II framework and the Basel I revisions might have on our banking 
        system. The proposals are intended to provide the right incentives for 
        bankers, but if the proposals do not achieve this goal, we want to know 
        why. In the past, when we have been provided with well-documented and 
        convincing reasons for making a change to the Basel II framework or the 
        U.S. implementation process, we have heeded those arguments. We expect 
        to have the same posture regarding comments on the proposed Basel I amendments. 
        We continue to recognize that vigorous discussion and debate produce a 
        much better product. And we expect to remain vigilant about the potentially 
        unintended and undesired consequences, particularly those that might affect 
        a certain class of banks.

[SECTION]

Additionally, I would like to emphasize that from my perspective the 
        U.S. agencies continue to work well with one another on these regulatory 
        capital proposals in a general environment of cooperation and good will. 
        While the U.S. agencies naturally disagree on certain policy matters and 
        implementation issues from time to time, we at the Federal Reserve are 
        pleased with the outcomes to date and recognize that all four agencies 
        are making considerable contributions to the overall effort.

[SECTION]

Dialogue with the Industry
        The extension of the U.S. timeline for Basel II, along with the ongoing 
        proposals for amended Basel I, obviously present some challenges for U.S. 
        institutions. We will continue our efforts to ensure that we hear about 
        these challenges and do our best to assist institutions in meeting them. 
        First of all, bankers must keep track of the latest proposals and understand 
        what they could mean for their own institutions. For those institutions 
        looking to prepare for adoption of Basel II, making the manifold upgrades 
        in risk-measurement and -management systems--not the least of which is 
        developing credible databases--is even more difficult, especially since 
        complete and final supervisory expectations have yet to be released. But 
        we certainly hope that institutions do not lose momentum based on the 
        revised timeline for Basel II; indeed, that timeline reflects our assessment 
        of the work that still lies ahead.

[SECTION]

While institutions might be challenged to move forward in certain areas 
        until the Basel II NPR and its associated supervisory guidance is issued, 
        we still believe that they can make strides in other areas. For one, the 
        agencies all along have emphasized the importance of institution-specific 
        implementation plans, which include gap analyses, clearly defined milestones, 
        and remediation plans. In other words, we think that institutions could 
        now continue development of the corporate governance surrounding each 
        institution's efforts in Basel II implementation and focus on their 
        individual implementation processes. In addition, supervisors have begun 
        to discuss individual QIS4 results with each participant; these discussions 
        include specific feedback about the institution's results and some 
        general peer comparisons.

Additionally, we do recognize that the recent update to U.S. implementation 
        plans could generate some challenges for U.S. institutions as they try 
        to implement Basel II worldwide, as well as for foreign banks operating 
        in the United States. Overall, we think these challenges are manageable 
        and we can facilitate solutions to them during the implementation process. 
        While not downplaying potential challenges, the U.S. agencies, in deciding 
        to adjust implementation plans, thought it was important to ensure that 
        implementation in the United States be conducted in a prudential manner 
        and without generating competitive inequalities in our banking markets. 
        As before the September 30 announcement, we continue to work with institutions 
        and foreign supervisors to minimize the difficulties in cross-border implementation. 
        Our support includes extensive discussion with other countries in the 
        Basel Accord Implementation Group, as well as more informal, bilateral 
        discussions with institutions and foreign supervisors. Our view is that 
        these cross-border issues do not necessarily represent fundamentally new 
        problems; while requiring some work, these challenges are manageable. 
        It is also useful to point out that all Basel member countries have their 
        own rollout timelines and national discretion issues, not just the United 
        States--which is entirely appropriate. In order to assist institutions 
        in resolving their cross-border challenges, we are eager to hear specifics 
        from institutions so that we can develop targeted solutions.

Conclusion
        Mr. Chairman, in my remarks today I have described the Federal Reserve's 
        views on suggested changes to the current regulatory risk-based capital 
        regime, namely the proposals for Basel II and amended Basel I. I have 
        outlined the need for change, the work completed to date, and some of 
        the lessons learned. In our view, recent exercises such as QIS4 have served 
        as useful indicators of the progress being made and the direction needed 
        for these initiatives on regulatory capital requirements. QIS4 was part 
        of an extended series of activities to ensure that the suggested regulatory 
        capital revisions are implemented in an appropriate and prudent manner. 
        From the Federal Reserve's perspective, we should continue to move 
        forward with the activities I described, while seeking comment and listening 
        to feedback at every stage.

Our support for Basel II stems from the belief that it would provide 
        a much better measure of minimum regulatory capital at the largest, most 
        complex institutions, aligning capital with risks to which these institutions 
        are exposed. We also believe that Basel II would bring about substantial 
        improvements in risk management to those institutions. At the same time, 
        amending Basel I for the vast majority of banking institutions in the 
        United States could improve the reflection of risks in Basel I-based rules 
        without much additional burden. Taken together, these initiatives should 
        ensure adequate minimum capital cushions, allow fair competition, maintain 
        safety and soundness, and enhance financial stability.
