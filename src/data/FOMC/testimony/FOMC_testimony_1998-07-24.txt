Chairman Greenspan presented identical testimony before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, July 22, 1998

[SECTION]

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I
         appreciate this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's
         midyear report on monetary policy.

[SECTION]

Overall, the performance of the U.S. economy
         continues to be impressive.  Over the first part of the year, we
         experienced further gains in output and employment, subdued
         prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  Important
         crosscurrents, however, have been impacting the economy.
         With labor markets very tight and domestic final demand
         retaining considerable momentum, the risks of a pickup in
         inflation remain significant.  But inventory investment, which
         was quite rapid late last year and early this year, appears to
         have slowed, perhaps appreciably. Moreover, the economic
         and financial troubles in Asian economies are now
         demonstrably restraining demands for U.S. goods and
         services--and those troubles could intensify and spread further.
         Weighing these forces, the Federal Open Market Committee
         chose to keep the stance of policy unchanged over the first half
         of 1998.  However, should pressures on labor resources begin
         to show through more impressively in cost increases, policy
         action may need to counter any associated tendency for prices
         to accelerate before it undermines this extraordinary
         expansion.

[SECTION]

Recent Developments

              When I appeared before your committee in February, I
         noted that a key question for monetary policy was whether the
         consequences of the turmoil in Asia would be sufficient to
         check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from
         the strength of domestic spending and tightening labor
         markets.  After the economy's surge in 1996 and, especially,
         last year, resource utilization, particularly that of the labor
         force, had risen to a very high level.  Although some signs
         pointed to stepped-up increases in productivity, the speed at
         which the demand for goods and services had been growing
         clearly exceeded the rate of expansion of the economy's
         long-run potential to produce.  Maintenance of such a pace
         would put even greater pressures on the economy's resources,
         threatening the balance and longevity of the expansion.

[SECTION]

However, it appeared likely that the difficulties being
         encountered by Asian economies, by cutting into U.S. exports,
         would be a potentially important factor slowing the growth of
         aggregate demand in the United States.  But uncertainties
         about the timing and dimensions of that development were
         considerable given the difficulties in assessing the extent of the
         problems in East Asia.

[SECTION]

In the event, the contraction of output and incomes in a
         number of Asian economies has turned out to be more
         substantial than most had anticipated.  Moreover, financial
         markets in Asia and in emerging market economies generally
         have remained unsettled, portending further difficult
         adjustments.  The contraction in Asian economies, along with
         the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over 1997,
         prompted a sharp deterioration in the U.S. balance of trade in
         the first quarter.  Nonetheless, the American economy proved
         to be unexpectedly robust in that period.  The growth of real
         GDP not only failed to slow, it climbed further, to about a 5-1/2
         percent annual rate in the first quarter, according to the current
         national income accounts.  Domestic private demand for goods
         and services--including personal consumption expenditures,
         business investment, and residential expenditures--was
         exceptionally strong.

[SECTION]

Evidently, optimism about jobs, incomes, and profits,
         high and rising wealth-to-income ratios, low financing costs,
         and falling prices for high-tech goods fed the appetites of
         households and businesses for consumer durables and capital
         equipment.  In addition, inventory investment contributed
         significantly to growth in the first quarter; indeed, the growth
         of stocks of materials and goods outpaced that of overall
         output by a wide margin during the first quarter, adding 1
         percentage points to the annualized growth rate of GDP.
         Although accumulation of some products likely was
         unintended, surveys indicate that much of the stockbuilding
         probably reflected firms' confidence in the prospects for
         continued growth.

[SECTION]

As evidence piled up that the economy continued to
         run hot during the winter, the Federal Reserve's concerns
         about inflationary pressures mounted.  Domestic demand
         clearly had more underlying momentum than we had
         anticipated, supported in part by financial conditions that were
         quite accommodative.  Credit remained extremely easy for
         most borrowers to obtain; intermediate- and long-term interest
         rates were at relatively low levels; equity prices soared
         higher, despite some disappointing earnings reports; and growth
         in the monetary aggregates was rapid.  Indeed, the crises in
         Asia, by lowering longer-term U.S. interest rates--through
         stronger preferences for dollar investments and expectations of
         slower growth ahead--and by reducing commodity prices, probably
         added to the positive forces boosting domestic spending in the
         first half, especially in the interest-sensitive housing sector.
         The robust expansion of demand tightened labor markets
         further, giving additional impetus to the upward trend in labor
         costs.  Inflation was low--though, given the lags with which
         monetary policy affects the economy and prices, we had to be
         mainly concerned not with conditions at the moment but with
         those likely to prevail many months ahead.  In these
         circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committee elected in
         March to move to a state of heightened alert against inflation,
         but left the stance of policy unchanged.

[SECTION]

Although national income and product data for the
         second quarter have not yet been published, growth of U.S.
         output appears to have slowed sharply.  The auto strike has
         brought General Motor's production essentially to a halt,
         probably reducing real GDP in the second quarter by about 1/2
         percentage point at an annual rate.  The limited available
         information on inventory investment suggests that
         stockbuilding dropped markedly from its unsustainable pace of
         the first quarter.  In addition to the slower pace of inventory
         building, Asian economies have continued to deteriorate,
         further retarding our exports in recent months.

[SECTION]

Indeed, readings on the elements that make up the real
         GDP have led many analysts to anticipate a decline in that
         measure in the second quarter, after the first-quarter surge.
         Given the upcoming revisions to the national income accounts,
         such assessments would have to be regarded as conjectural.  It
         is worth noting in any case that other indicators of output,
         including worker hours and manufacturing production, show a
         somewhat steadier, though slowing, path over the first half of
         the year.  And underlying trends in domestic final demand
         have remained strong, imparting impetus to the continuing
         economic expansion.

[SECTION]

During the first half of the year, measures of resource
         utilization diverged.  Pressures on manufacturing facilities
         appeared to be easing.  Plant capacity was growing rapidly as a
         result of vigorous investment.  And growth of industrial output
         was dropping off from its brisk pace of 1997, importantly
         reflecting the deceleration in world demand for manufactured
         goods that resulted from the Asian economic difficulties.

[SECTION]

But labor markets, in contrast, became increasingly taut
         during the first half.  Total payroll jobs rose about
         one-and-one-half million over the first six months of the year.
         The civilian unemployment rate dropped to a bit below 4-1/2
         percent in the second quarter, its lowest level in three
         decades.  Firms resorted to a variety of tactics to attract and
         retain workers, such as paying various types of monetary bonuses
         and raising basic wage rates. But, at least through the first
         quarter, the effects of a rising wage bill on production costs
         were moderated by strong gains in productivity.

[SECTION]

Indeed, inflation stayed remarkably damped during the
         first quarter.  The consumer price index as well as broader
         measures of prices indicate that inflation moved down further,
         even as the economy strengthened.  Although declining oil
         prices contributed to this development, pricing leverage in the
         goods-producing sector more generally was held in check by
         reduced demand from Asia that, among other things, has led to
         a softening of commodity prices, a strong dollar that has
         contributed to bargain prices on many imports, and rising
         industrial capacity.  Service price inflation, less influenced
         by international events, has remained steady at about a 3
         percent rate since before the beginning of the crisis.

[SECTION]

Some elements in the goods price mix clearly were
         transitory.  Indeed, the more recent price data suggest that
         overall consumer price inflation moved up in the second
         quarter.  But, even so, the increase remained moderate.

[SECTION]

In any event, it would be a mistake for monetary policy
         makers to focus on any single index in gauging inflation
         pressures in the economy.  Although much public attention is
         directed to the CPI, the Federal Reserve monitors a wide
         variety of aggregate price measures.  Each is designed for a
         particular purpose and has its own strengths and weaknesses.
         Price pressures appear especially absent in some of the
         measures in the national income accounts, which are available
         through the first quarter.  The chain-weight price index for
         personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy,
         for example, rose 1.5 percent over the year ending in the first
         quarter, considerably less than the 2.3 percent rise in the core
         CPI over the same period.  An even broader price measure,
         that for overall GDP, rose 1.4 percent.  These indexes, while
         certainly subject to many of the measurement difficulties the
         Bureau of Labor Statistics has been grappling with in the CPI,
         have the advantages that their chain-weighting avoids some
         aspects of so-called substitution bias and that already
         published data can be revised to incorporate new information
         and measurement techniques.  Taken together, while the
         various price indexes show some differences, the basic
         message is that inflation to date has remained low.

Economic Fundamentals: The Virtuous Cycle

              So far this year, our economy has continued to enjoy a
         virtuous cycle.  Evidence of accelerated productivity has been
         bolstering expectations of future corporate earnings, thereby
         fueling still further increases in equity values, and the
         improvements in productivity have been helping to reduce
         inflation.  In the context of subdued price increases and
         generally supportive credit conditions, rising equity values
         have provided impetus to spending and, in turn, the expansion
         of output, employment, and productivity-enhancing capital
         investment.

[SECTION]

The essential precondition for the emergence, and
         persistence, of this virtuous cycle is arguably the decline in
         the rate of inflation to near price stability.  In recent years,
         continued low product price inflation and expectations that it
         will persist have promoted stability in financial markets and
         fostered perceptions that the degree of risk in the financial
         outlook has been moving ever lower.  These perceptions, in
         turn, have reduced the extra compensation that investors
         require for making loans to, or taking ownership positions in,
         private firms.  With risks in the domestic economy judged to
         be low, credit and equity capital have been readily available
         for many businesses, fostering strong investment.  And low
         mortgage interest rates have allowed many households to
         purchase homes and to refinance outstanding debt.  The
         reduction in debt servicing costs has contributed to an apparent
         stabilization of the financial strains on the household sector
         that seemed to emerge a couple of years ago and has buoyed
         consumer demand.

[SECTION]

To a considerable extent, investors seem to be
         expecting that low inflation and stronger productivity growth
         will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended
         into the distant future.  Indeed, expectations of earnings
         growth over the longer term have been undergoing continual
         upward revision by security analysts since early 1995.  These
         rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock prices sharply
         higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps in both cases to levels
         that will be difficult to sustain unless the virtuous cycle
         continues.  In any event, primarily because of the rise in stock
         prices, about $12-1/2 trillion has been added to the value of
         household assets since the end of 1994.  Probably only a few
         percent of these largely unrealized capital gains have been
         transformed into the purchase of goods and services in
         consumer markets.  But that increment to spending, combined
         with the sharp increase in equipment investment, which has
         stemmed from the low cost of both equity and debt relative to
         expected profits on capital, has been instrumental in propelling
         the economy forward.

[SECTION]

The consequences for the American worker have been
         dramatic and, for the most part, highly favorable.  A great
         many chronically underemployed people have been given the
         opportunity to work, and many others have been able to
         upgrade their skills as a result of work experience, extensive
         increases in on-the-job training, or increased enrollment in
         technical programs in community colleges and elsewhere.  In
         addition, former welfare recipients appear to have been
         absorbed into the work force in significant numbers.

[SECTION]

Government finances have been enhanced as well.
         Widespread improvement has been evident in the financial
         positions of state and local governments.  In the federal
         sector, the taxes paid on huge realized capital gains and other
         incomes related to stock market advances, coupled with taxes on
         markedly higher corporate profits, have joined with restraint
         on spending to produce a unified budget surplus for the first
         time in nearly three decades.  The important steps taken by the
         Congress and the Administration to put federal finances on a
         sounder footing have added to national saving, relieving
         pressures on credit markets.  The paydown of debt associated
         with the federal surplus has helped to hold down longer-term
         interest rates, which in turn has encouraged capital formation
         and reduced debt burdens.  Maintaining this disciplined budget
         stance would be most helpful in supporting a continuation of
         our current robust economic performance in the years ahead.

[SECTION]

The fact that economic performance has strengthened
         as inflation subsided should not have been surprising, given
         that risk premiums and economic disincentives to invest in
         productive capital diminish as the economy approaches price
         stability.  But the extent to which strong growth and high labor
         force utilization have been joined with low inflation over an
         extended period is, nevertheless, exceptional.  So far, at
         least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so
         central a role in pressuring inflation higher in many past
         business expansions--eventually bringing those expansions to an
         end--have not played a significant role in the current
         expansion.

[SECTION]

For one thing, increases in hourly compensation have
         been slower to pick up than in most other recent expansions,
         although, to be sure, wages have started to accelerate in the
         past couple of years as the labor market has become
         progressively tighter.  In the first few years of the expansion,
         the subdued rate of rise in hourly compensation seemed to be,
         in part, a reflection of greater concerns among workers about
         job security.  We now seem to have moved beyond that phase
         of especially acute concern, though the flux of technology may
         still be leaving many workers with fears of job skill
         obsolescence and a willingness to trade wage gains for job
         security.  In the past couple of years, of course, workers have
         not had to press especially hard for nominal pay gains to
         realize sizable increases in their real wages.  In contrast to
         the pattern that developed in several previous business
         expansions, when workers required substantial increases in pay
         just to cover increases in the cost of living, consumer prices
         have been generally well-behaved in the current expansion.

[SECTION]

A couple of years ago--almost at the same time that
         increases in total hourly compensation began trending up in
         nominal terms--evidence of a long-awaited pickup in the
         growth of labor productivity began to show through more
         strongly in the data; and this accelerated increase in output
         per hour has enabled firms to raise workers' real wages  while
         holding the line on price increases.  Gains in productivity
         usually vary with the strength of the economy, and the
         favorable results that we have observed during the past two
         years or so, when the economy has been growing more rapidly,
         almost certainly overstate the degree of structural
         improvement.  But evidence continues to mount that the trend
         of productivity has accelerated, even if the extent of that
         pickup is as yet unclear.  Signs of major technological
         improvements are all around us, and the benefits are evident
         not only in high-tech industries but also in production
         processes that have long been part of our industrial economy.

[SECTION]

Those technological innovations and the rapidly
         declining cost of capital equipment that embodies them in turn
         seem to be a major factor behind the recent enlarged gains in
         productivity.  Evidently, plant managers who were involved in
         planning capital investments anticipated that a significant
         increase in the real rates of return on facilities could be
         achieved by exploiting emerging new technologies.  If that had
         been a mistake on their part, one would have expected capital
         investment to run up briefly and then start down again when
         the lower-than-anticipated rates of return developed.  But we
         have instead seen sustained gains in investment, indicating that
         hoped-for rates of return apparently have been realized.

[SECTION]

Notwithstanding a reasonably optimistic interpretation
         of the recent productivity numbers, it would not be prudent to
         assume that even strongly rising productivity, by itself, can
         ensure a non-inflationary future.  Certainly wage increases, per
         se, are not inflationary, unless they exceed productivity
         growth, thereby creating pressure for inflationary price
         increases that can eventually undermine economic growth and
         employment.  Because the level of productivity is tied to an
         important degree to the stock of capital, which turns over only
         gradually, increases in the trend growth of productivity
         probably also occur rather gradually.  By contrast, the
         potential for abrupt acceleration of nominal hourly compensation
         is surely greater.

[SECTION]

As I have noted in previous appearances before
         Congress, economic growth at rates experienced on average
         over the past several years would eventually run into
         constraints as the reservoir of unemployed people available to
         work is drawn down.  The annual increase in the working-age
         population (from 16 to 64 years of age), including immigrants,
         has been approximately 1 percent a year in recent years.  Yet
         employment, measured by the count of persons who are
         working rather than by the count of jobs, has been rising 2
         percent a year since 1995, despite the acceleration in the
         growth of output per hour.  The gap between employment
         growth and population growth, amounting to about 1.1 million
         persons a year on average since the end of 1995, has been
         made up, in part, by a decline in the number of individuals
         who are counted as unemployed--those persons who are
         actively seeking work--of approximately 650,000 a year, on
         average, over the past two and one-half years.  The remainder
         of the gap has reflected a rise in labor force participation
         that can be traced largely to a decline of almost 300,000 a year
         in the number of individuals (aged 16 to 64) wanting a job but
         not actively seeking one.  Presumably, many of the persons
         who once were in this group have more recently become active
         and successful job-seekers as the economy has strengthened,
         thereby preventing a still sharper drop in the official
         unemployment rate.  In June, the number of persons aged 16 to
         64 who wanted to work but who did not have jobs was 10.6
         million on a seasonally adjusted basis, roughly 6 percent of the
         working-age population.  Despite an uptick in joblessness in
         June, this percentage is only fractionally above the record low
         reached in May for these data, which can be calculated back to
         1970.

[SECTION]

Nonetheless, a strong signal of inflation pressures
         building because of compensation increases markedly in
         excess of productivity gains has not yet clearly emerged in this
         expansion.  Among nonfinancial corporations (our most recent
         source of data on consolidated income statements), trends in
         costs seem to have accelerated from their lows, but the rates of
         increase in both unit labor costs and total unit costs are still
         quite low.

[SECTION]

Still, the gap between the growth in employment and
         that of the working-age population will inevitably close.  What
         is crucial to sustaining this unprecedented period of prosperity
         is that it close reasonably promptly, given already stretched
         labor resources, and that labor markets find a balance
         consistent with sustained growth marked by compensation
         gains in line with productivity advances.  Whether these
         adjustments will occur without monetary policy action remains
         an open question.

Foreign Developments

              While the United States has been benefiting from a
         virtuous economic cycle, a number of other economies
         unfortunately have been spiraling in quite the opposite
         direction.  The United States, Canada, and Western Europe
         have been enjoying solid economic growth, with relatively low
         inflation and declining unemployment, but the economic
         performance in many developing and transition nations and
         Japan has been deteriorating.  How quickly the latter erosion is
         arrested and reversed will be a key factor in shaping U.S.
         economic and financial trends in the period ahead.  With all
         that is at stake, it would be difficult to overstate how crucial
         it is that the authorities in the relevant economies promptly
         implement effective policies to correct the structural problems
         underlying recent weaknesses and to promote sustainable
         economic growth before patterns of reinforcing contraction
         become difficult to contain.

[SECTION]

Conditions in Asia are of particular concern.
         Aggregate output of the Asian developing economies has
         plunged, with particularly steep declines in Korea, Malaysia,
         Thailand, and Indonesia.  Even the economies of the stalwart
         tigers--Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan--have softened.
         Economic growth in China has also slowed, owing largely to
         the currency depreciations among its neighbors and the sharp
         declines in their demand for imports.

[SECTION]

Russia has also experienced some spillover from the
         Asian difficulties, but Russia's problems are mostly
         homegrown.  Large fiscal deficits stem from high effective
         marginal tax rates that encourage avoidance and do not raise
         adequate revenue.  This and the recent declines in prices of oil
         and other commodities have rendered Russian financial
         markets and the ruble vulnerable, particularly in an
         environment of heightened concern about all emerging
         markets.  The Russian government has recently promulgated a
         set of new policy measures in connection with an expanded
         IMF support package in an effort to address these problems.

[SECTION]

In Latin America, conditions vary:  Economies that are
         heavily dependent on exports of oil and other commodities
         have suffered as prices of those items have fallen, and several
         countries in that region have received more intensive scrutiny
         in international capital markets, but, on the whole, Latin
         American economies continue to perform reasonably well.

[SECTION]

Disappointingly, economic activity in Japan--a crucial
         engine of Asian economic growth--has turned down after a
         long period of subpar growth.  Gross domestic product fell at a
         5-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  More recently,
         confidence of households and businesses has continued to
         erode, the sharp contraction elsewhere in Asia has fed back
         onto Japan, and the dwindling domestic demand for goods and
         services in that country has been further constrained by a
         mounting credit crunch.  Nonperforming loans have risen
         sharply as real estate values fell following the bursting of the
         asset bubble in 1991.  Problems in the banking sector,
         exacerbated by the broader Asian financial crisis, have led to
         market concerns about the adequacy of the capital of many
         Japanese banks and have engendered a premium in the market
         for Japanese banks' borrowing.  This resulting squeeze to
         profit margins has led to a reluctance to lend in dollars or
         yen.  In response to the weakening economy and deteriorating
         banking situation, the Japanese yen has tended to weaken
         significantly, in often-volatile markets, against the dollar and
         major European currencies.

[SECTION]

As you know, we have sought to be helpful in the
         Japanese government's efforts to stabilize their economy and
         financial system, reflecting our awareness of the important role
         that Japanese financial and economic performance plays in the
         world economy, including that of the United States.  We have
         consulted with the relevant Japanese authorities on methods
         for resolving difficulties in their banking system and have
         urged them to take effective measures to stimulate their
         economy.  I believe that the Japanese authorities recognize the
         urgency of the situation.

[SECTION]

That a number of foreign economies are currently
         experiencing difficulties is not surprising.  Although many had
         previously realized a substantial measure of success in
         developing their economies, a number had leaned heavily on
         command-type systems rather than relying primarily on market
         mechanisms.  This characteristic has been evident not only in
         their industrial sectors but in banking where government
         intervention is typically heavy, where long-standing personal
         and corporate relationships are the predominant factor in
         financing arrangements, and where market-based credit
         assessments are the exception rather than the rule.  Recent
         events confirm that these sorts of structures are ill-suited to
         today's dynamic global economy, in which national economies
         must be capable of adapting flexibly and rapidly to changing
         conditions.

[SECTION]

Responses in countries currently experiencing
         difficulties have varied considerably.  Some have reacted
         quickly and, in general terms, appropriately.  But in others, a
         variety of political considerations appear to have militated
         against prompt and effective action.

[SECTION]

As a consequence, the risks of further adverse
         developments in these economies remain substantial.  And
         given the pervasive interconnections of virtually all economies
         and financial systems in the world today, the associated
         uncertainties for the United States and other developed
         economies remain substantial as well.

[SECTION]

In the current circumstances, we need to be aware that
         monetary policy tightening actions in the United States could
         have outsized effects on very sensitive financial markets in
         Asia, a development that could have substantial adverse
         repercussions on U.S. financial markets and, over time, on our
         own economy.  But while we must take account of such
         foreign interactions, we must be careful that our responses
         ultimately are consistent with a monetary policy aimed at
         optimal performance of the U.S. economy.  Our objectives
         relate to domestic economic performance, and price stability
         and maximum sustainable economic growth here at home
         would best serve the long-run interests of troubled financial
         markets and economies abroad.

[SECTION]

The Economic Outlook

              The Federal Open Market Committee believes that the
         conditions for continued growth with low inflation are in place
         here in the United States.  As I noted previously, an important
         issue for policy is how the imbalance of recent years between
         the demand for labor and the growth of the working-age
         population is resolved.  In that regard, we see a slowing of
         the growth in aggregate demand as a necessary element in the mix.

[SECTION]

At this time, some of the key factors that have
         supported strong final demand by domestic purchasers remain
         favorable.  Although real short-term interest rates have risen
         as the federal funds rate has been held unchanged while
         inflation expectations have declined, the financial conditions
         that have fostered the strength in demand are still in place.
         With their incomes and wealth having been on a strong upward
         track, American consumers remain quite upbeat.  For businesses,
         decreasing costs of and high rates of return on investment, as
         well as the scarcity of labor, could keep capital spending
         elevated.  These factors suggest some risk that the labor
         market could get even tighter.  And even if it does not, under
         prevailing tight labor markets increasingly confident workers
         might place gradually escalating pressures on wages and costs,
         which would eventually feed through to prices.

[SECTION]

But a number of factors likely will serve to damp
         growth in aggregate demand, helping to foster a reasonably
         smooth transition to a more sustainable rate of growth and
         reasonable balance in labor markets.  We have yet to see the
         full effects of the crisis in East Asia on U.S. employment and
         income.  Residential and business fixed investment already
         have reached such high levels that further gains approaching
         those experienced recently would imply very rapid growth of
         the stocks of housing and plant and equipment relative to
         income trends.  Moreover, business investment will be damped
         if recent indications of a narrowing in domestic operating
         profit margins prompt a reassessment of the expected rates of
         return on investment in plant and equipment.  Reduced
         prospects for the return to capital would not only affect
         investment directly but could also affect consumption if stock
         prices adjust to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects.

[SECTION]

Of course, the demand for labor that is consistent with
         a particular rate of output growth also could be lowered if
         productivity growth were to increase more.  And, on the supply
         side of the labor market, faster growth of the labor force could
         emerge as the result of increased immigration or delayed
         retirements.  Nonetheless, it appears most probable that the
         necessary slower absorption of labor into employment will
         reflect, in part, a deceleration of output growth, as a
         consequence of evolving market forces.  Failing that, firming
         actions on the part of the Federal Reserve may be necessary to
         ensure a track of expansion that is capable of being sustained.

[SECTION]

Thus, members of the Board of Governors and
         presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks anticipate a slowing
         in the rate of economic growth.  The central tendency of their
         forecasts is that real GDP will rise 3 to 3-1/4 percent over
         1998 as a whole and 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 1999.  With the rise
         in the demand for workers coming into line with that of the
         labor force, the unemployment rate is expected to change little
         from its current level, finishing next year in the neighborhood
         of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4  percent.

[SECTION]

Inflation performance will be affected by developments
         abroad as well as those here at home.  The extent and pace of
         recovery of Asian economies currently experiencing a severe
         downturn will have important implications for prices of energy
         and other commodities, the strength of the dollar, and
         competitive conditions on world product markets.  Should the
         situation abroad remain unsettled, these factors would
         probably continue to contribute to good price performance in
         the United States in the period ahead.  But it is important to
         recognize that the damping influence of these factors on
         inflation is mostly temporary.  At some point, the dollar will
         stop rising, foreign demand will begin to recover, and oil and
         other commodity prices will stop falling and could even back
         up some.  Indeed, a brisk snap-back in foreign economic
         activity, should that occur, would add, at least temporarily, to
         price pressures in the United States.

[SECTION]

On a more fundamental level, it is the balance of supply
         and demand in labor and product markets in the United States
         that will have the greatest effect on inflation rates here.  As
         I noted previously, wage and benefit costs have been remarkably
         subdued in the current expansion.  Nonetheless, an
         accelerating trend in wages has been apparent for some time.

[SECTION]

In addition, a gradual upward tilt in benefit costs has
         become evident of late.  A variety of factors--including the
         strength of the economy and rising equity values, which have
         reduced the need for payments into unemployment trust funds
         and pension plans, and the restructuring of the health care
         sector--have been working to keep benefit costs in check in
         this expansion.  But, in the medical area at least, the most
         recent developments suggest that the favorable trend may have
         run its course.  The slowing of price increases for medical
         services seems to have come to a halt, at least for a time, and,
         with the cost-saving shift to managed care having been largely
         completed, the potential for businesses to achieve further
         savings in that regard appears to be rather limited at this
         point.  There have been a few striking instances this past year
         of employers boosting outlays for health benefits by substantial
         amounts.

[SECTION]

Given that compensation costs are likely to accelerate at
         least a little further, productivity trends and profit margins
         will be key to determining price performance in the period
         ahead.  Whether the recent strong performance of productivity
         can be extended remains to be seen.  It does seem likely that
         productivity calculated for the entire economy using GDP data
         weakened in the second quarter.  This development clearly
         owed, at least in some degree, to the deceleration of output in
         that period.  In manufacturing, where our data are better
         measured, productivity appears still to have registered a solid
         increase.  We will be closely monitoring a variety of indicators
         to assess how productivity is performing in the months ahead.

[SECTION]

Monetary policymakers see the most likely outcome as
         modestly higher inflation rates in the next one and one-half
         years.  The central tendency of monetary policymakers' CPI
         inflation forecasts is for an increase of 1-3/4 to 2 percent
         during 1998 and 2 to 2-1/2 percent next year.  As noted, the
         ebbing of the special factors reducing inflation over the past
         year or so, such as the decline in oil prices, will account for
         some of this uptick.  But the Federal Open Market Committee will
         need to remain particularly alert to the possibility that more
         fundamental imbalances are increasing inflationary pressures.
         The Committee would need to resist vigorously any tendency
         for an upward trend, which could become embedded in the
         inflationary process.

[SECTION]

The Committee recognizes that significant risks attend
         the outlook:  One is that the impending constraint from
         domestic labor markets could bind more abruptly than it has to
         date, intensifying inflation pressures.  The other is the
         potential for further adverse developments abroad, which could
         reduce the demand for U.S. goods and services more sharply than
         anticipated and which would thereby ease pressures on labor
         markets.  While we expect that the situation will develop
         relatively smoothly, the Committee believes that, given the
         current tightness in labor markets, the potential for
         accelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of
         protracted, excessive weakness in the economy.  In any case, it
         will need to continue to monitor evolving circumstances
         closely, and adjust the stance of monetary policy as
         appropriate, in order to help establish conditions consistent
         with progress towards the Federal Reserve's goals of price
         stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.

[SECTION]

Ranges for Money and Credit Growth

              Indeed, recognition of the benefits of low inflation and
         our commitment to the Federal Reserve's statutory objective of
         price stability were once again dominant in the Committee's
         semiannual review of the ranges for the monetary and debt
         aggregates.  The FOMC noted that the behavior of the
         monetary aggregates had been somewhat more predictable
         over the past few years than it had been earlier in the 1990s.
         The rapid growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of the year,
         which lifted those measures above the upper ends of the target
         ranges established in February, was consistent with the
         unexpectedly strong advance in aggregate demand.  However,
         movements in velocity remain difficult to predict.

[SECTION]

The FOMC will continue to interpret the monetary
         ranges as benchmarks for the achievement of price stability
         under conditions of historically normal velocity behavior.
         Consistent with that interpretation, the Committee decided to
         retain the current ranges for the monetary aggregates for 1998,
         as well as the range for debt, and to carry them over on a
         provisional basis to next year.  Although near-term prospects
         for velocity behavior are uncertain, the Committee recognizes
         that monetary growth does appear to provide some information
         about trends in the economy and inflation.  Therefore, we will
         be carefully evaluating the aggregates, relative both to
         forecasts and to their ranges, in the context of other readings
         on other variables in our efforts to promote optimum
         macroeconomic conditions.

[SECTION]

Concluding Comments

              As I have stated in previous testimony, the recent
         economic performance, with its combination of strong growth
         and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in
         my near half-century of daily observation of the American
         economy.  Although the reasons for this development are
         complex, our success can be attributed in part to sound
         economic policy.  The Congress and the Administration have
         successfully balanced the budget and, indeed, achieved a
         near-term surplus, a development that tends to boost national
         saving and investment.  The Federal Reserve has pursued
         monetary conditions consistent with maximum sustainable
         long-run growth by seeking price stability.  These policies
         have helped bring about a healthy macroeconomic
         environment for productivity-boosting investment and
         innovation, factors that have lifted living standards for most
         Americans.  The task before us is to maintain disciplined
         economic policies and thereby contribute to maintaining and
         extending these gains in the years ahead.
