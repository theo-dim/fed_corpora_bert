Chairman King, Congresswoman Maloney, members of the Subcommittee on 
        Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology: It is 
        a pleasure to appear before you this morning on behalf of the Board of 
        Governors of the Federal Reserve System to discuss Basel II, the evolving 
        new capital standard for internationally active banks and bank holding 
        companies. At this time, bank supervisors in this country and abroad are 
        evaluating the results of a recent survey to assess the potential quantitative 
        impact of the current proposals on the world's large banks. In addition, 
        the supervisors in the United States are still incorporating feedback 
        from our discussions with bankers, an ongoing process that will continue 
        even after final rules are adopted. From the U.S. perspective, a hallmark 
        of the Basel II process has been the effort to tailor the capital framework 
        to the evolving industry best practices. We intend for these dynamic efforts 
        to continue.

[SECTION]

That having been said, after almost five years of discussion and revision, 
        Basel II is about ready for the last rounds of comment--which we anticipate 
        this spring and summer. We expect the Basel Committee to approve its package 
        by late this year, the corresponding U.S. rulemaking process to be completed 
        next year, and implementation to begin in late 2006. Banks need some certainty 
        for planning, but this is not inconsistent with further changes between 
        2004 and 2006, and thereafter, as we learn more and as practices evolve.

[SECTION]

Why Is a New Capital Standard Necessary? 
        The supervisors in this country have determined that Basel I, the current 
        capital regime adopted in 1988, must be replaced for the most complex 
        banks for three major reasons: defects in Basel I as it applies to these 
        large entities, evolution in the art of risk management, and increased 
        heterogeneity and concentration in the banking system.

[SECTION]

Defects in Basel I. Basel I was a major step 
        forward in capital regulation. Indeed, for most banks in this country, 
        Basel I is now--and for the foreseeable future will be-- more than adequate 
        as a capital framework. Most banking institutions in this country engage 
        in businesses with risks that counterparties and supervisors can evaluate 
        relatively easily. Moreover, because of their lack of geographical diversification 
        and/or limited alternative funding sources, the market continues to force 
        most banks to carry capital positions considerably in excess of regulatory 
        minimums under Basel I. For these reasons, U.S. supervisors do not believe 
        the benefits would exceed the costs of requiring most banks to shift to 
        Basel II. However, for the small number of large, complex, internationally 
        active banking organizations, Basel I has serious shortcomings, which 
        are becoming more evident with time. Developing a replacement to supply 
        to these banking organizations is imperative.

[SECTION]

First, Basel I is too simplistic to adequately address the activities 
        of our most complex banking institutions. Basel I categorizes each bank's 
        assets into one of only four categories, each of which represents a certain 
        risk class. Each risk class has its own risk weight that is multiplied 
        by 8 percent to get the minimum capital charge: zero for most sovereign 
        debt, 20 percent of 8 percent for most intra-bank exposures and for agency 
        securities, 50 percent of 8 percent for residential mortgages, and 100 
        percent of 8 percent for all other exposures. These "all other" credits 
        include essentially all corporate and consumer loans, meaning that the 
        whole spectrum of credit quality over which banks do much of their lending--from 
        Aaa to the most speculative credits--receives the same regulatory capital 
        charge. The lack of differentiation among the degrees of risk means that 
        the resultant capital ratios are too often uninformative and might well 
        provide misleading information for banks with risky or problem credits 
        or, for that matter, with portfolios dominated by very safe loans.

[SECTION]

Moreover, the limited number of risk classes not only limits the value 
        of the capital requirement but also creates a regulatory loophole that 
        creates incentives for banks to game the system by capital arbitrage. 
        Capital arbitrage, in this case, is the avoidance of certain minimum capital 
        charges through sale or securitization of those assets for which the capital 
        requirement that the market would impose is less than the regulatory capital 
        charge. Clearly, the market believes that the 4 percent capital charge 
        on most residential mortgages (50 percent of 8 percent) and the 8 percent 
        on most credit cards (100 percent of 8 percent) is higher than the real 
        risk, facilitating the securitization and sale of a large volume of such 
        loans to other holders. This behavior is perfectly understandable, even 
        desirable in an economic efficiency sense. But it means that banks that 
        engage in such arbitrage retain the higher-risk assets for which the regulatory 
        capital charge--calibrated to average quality assets--is on average too 
        low.

[SECTION]

Supervisors, through the examination process, are, to be sure, still 
        able to evaluate the true risk position of the bank, but the capital ratios 
        of the larger banks are becoming less and less meaningful, a trend that 
        will only accelerate. Not only are creditors, counterparties, and investors 
        less able to evaluate the capital strength of individual banks from what 
        are supposed to be risk-based capital ratios, but regulations and statutory 
        requirements tied to capital ratios have less meaning as well.

[SECTION]

The Evolving State of the Art. At the same 
        time, risk management and appropriate capital determination have evolved 
        significantly beyond the state of the art at the time Basel I was developed. 
        Banks themselves have developed and adopted some of the new techniques 
        to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures. 
        But clearly banks can go considerably further. Basel II would speed adoption 
        of these new techniques and promote the future evolution of risk management 
        by establishing a framework that is more risk-sensitive.

[SECTION]

Increased Heterogeneity and Concentration in Banking. 
        Finally, market pressures have led to consolidation in banking around 
        the world. Our own banking system has not been immune; it, too, has become 
        increasingly concentrated with a small number of very large banks operating 
        across a wide range of product and geographic markets. Their operations 
        are tremendously complex and sophisticated, and their significantly different 
        strategies add a high degree of heterogeneity to their operations. At 
        the same time, significant weakness in one of these entities, let alone 
        failure, has the potential for severely adverse macroeconomic consequences. 
        It seems clear that the regulatory framework should encourage these banks 
        to adopt the best possible risk measurement and management techniques 
        while allowing for the considerable differences in their business strategies. 
        Basel II presents an opportunity for supervisors to encourage these banks 
        to push their management frontier forward. Of course, change is always 
        difficult, and these new mechanisms are expensive. But a more risk-sensitive 
        regulatory and capital system would provide stronger incentives to adopt 
        best practice internal risk management.

[SECTION]

Let me be clear. If we do not apply more risk-sensitive capital requirements 
        to these very large institutions, the usefulness of capital adequacy regulation 
        in constraining excessive risk-taking at these entities will continue 
        to erode. Such an erosion would present U.S. bank supervisors with a highly 
        undesirable choice. Either we would have to accept the increased risk 
        of instability in the banking system, or we would be forced to adopt alternative--and 
        more intrusive--approaches to the supervision and regulation of these 
        institutions.

[SECTION]

Basel II 
        I want to stress that the U.S. supervisory authorities intend to apply 
        only the so-called Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB) version of 
        Basel II. We will not be adopting the two other variants of Basel 
        II--the Standardized and Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approaches--that 
        have been developed by the Basel Committee. We expect to require 
        about ten large U.S. banks to adopt the A-IRB approach, but we anticipate 
        that a small number of other large entities will choose to adopt 
        it as well after making the necessary investment to support their participation.

[SECTION]

All other banks in this country will remain on the current Basel I capital 
        standard when the new Accord is implemented. For these thousands of banks, 
        the shortfalls of the current rules, as noted, are not sufficiently large 
        to warrant a mandatory shift to the Basel II regime. However, any of these 
        institutions will have the option to adopt the A-IRB requirement, as we 
        expect some large entities to do at the outset. If they seek to do so, 
        however, they will have to meet the same high standards of internal infrastructure 
        and controls that will be required of the core group.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve Board believes that the A-IRB approach of Basel II 
        will address the material defects of Basel I for these entities. By requiring 
        strong internal standards as an entry criterion, the Basel II approach 
        will ensure that these banks adopt structured, formal, empirically based 
        methods of managing credit risk, which will lead to significantly improved 
        risk-management capabilities at the very largest banks and other adopters. 
        Capital requirements themselves will become more risk sensitive and less 
        prone to artificial distortions. The poor incentive structure of Basel 
        I will be removed for A-IRB banks. Supervisory practices will also become 
        more consistent with evolving risk-management practices. Risk-based capital 
        ratios will become more reliable as an indicator of financial strength.

[SECTION]

I turn now to another aspect of Basel II: its three pillars. At the outset 
        of the Basel II process, the supervisors on the Basel Committee determined 
        that a robust capital adequacy framework should include three important 
        elements or pillars. Pillar I consists of the minimum capital requirements 
        themselves--that is, the rules by which a bank calculates its capital 
        ratio and by which its supervisor assesses whether it is in compliance 
        with the minimum capital threshold. Pillar II, the supervisory oversight 
        pillar, encompasses the concept that well-managed banks should seek to 
        go beyond simple compliance with minimum standards and perform for themselves 
        a comprehensive assessment of whether they have sufficient capital to 
        support their risks. In addition, supervisors should be in a position 
        to provide constructive feedback to bank management on these internal 
        assessments, or "economic capital", based on their knowledge of industry 
        practices at a range of institutions. Finally, Pillar III seeks to complement 
        these activities with market discipline by requiring banks publicly to 
        disclose key measures related to their risk and capital positions. The 
        concept of these three mutually reinforcing pillars has been key to the 
        Basel II effort.

[SECTION]

Pillar I: Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements. 
        The minimum capital requirements for credit risk under the A-IRB approach 
        are built around the same concepts that underlie all modern portfolio-based 
        methods for systematically measuring credit risk. The first, and perhaps 
        most important, input to this approach is an estimate of the likelihood 
        or probability that a borrower will default. Second, lenders need a sense 
        of the size of the loss in the event of a default because they are often 
        able to recover something from a defaulted borrower's assets or from collateral 
        or a guarantee. Third, the lender, who often has an undrawn credit line 
        or loan commitment to a borrower, needs to estimate what the amount borrowed 
        is likely to be at the time a default occurs. These key inputs--probability 
        of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD)--are 
        the building blocks of the A-IRB approach to estimating capital requirements. 
        Many banks are currently working to improve their ability to estimate 
        these quantities, using a wide variety of techniques from expert judgment 
        methodologies to quantitative statistical models.

[SECTION]

A-IRB permits banks to use any or all of these, requiring only that the 
        procedure for estimating these three key parameters be based on empirical 
        information, that it be rigorous, that it be reproducible by third parties, 
        that the process be subject to strong internal controls, and that the 
        results be shown to measure risk accurately. The supervisor must, in fact, 
        validate the estimation procedures and the controls that support them 
        before a bank can use A-IRB. As part of the validation process, a bank 
        must demonstrate that these risk measures are in fact used in credit-granting 
        decisions, as well as for other management purposes such as reserving 
        and pricing. The intention is for the supervisor and the manager to focus 
        on the same issues.

[SECTION]

These estimated risk variables are inputs to regulatory formulas that 
        will determine the minimum required capital for a given portfolio of exposures. 
        Just as the methods of determining the inputs can change as the state 
        of the art changes, the formulas that translate the inputs into capital 
        requirements can be modified as well by the regulators. Basel II can improve 
        as knowledge improves.

[SECTION]

The rules surrounding Pillar I are clearly more complicated than I have 
        just described, and the volume of comment letters and the number of pages 
        that have been and will be published for comment will attest to that. 
        One reason for that complexity is that the large, complex banking organizations, 
        to which the rules are addressed are, in a word, complex. Simple rules 
        just cannot address their issues and the nature of their business. These 
        rules have been adjusted and modified significantly as a result of comments 
        from bankers and other interested parties. Sometimes those comments have 
        led to simpler rules. But, more often, they have led to even more complex 
        rules because each complex bank to which they apply operates somewhat 
        differently from other banks. Thus the rules have been modified to address 
        important and meaningful differences in risk. Simple rules too often become 
        straightjackets; flexibility requires more complex rules.

[SECTION]

Pillar II: Supervisory Oversight. Indeed, because 
        even complex rules cannot adequately capture the risks and desirable procedures 
        for each bank, the A-IRB establishes with Pillar II a mechanism for dialogue 
        on risk and capital between bank managers and bank supervisors. I have 
        already noted that supervisors will verify the process for determining 
        credit-risk measurement, for ensuring ongoing control over the process 
        of determining these risk-measure inputs, and for ensuring that the risk 
        inputs are used for more than calculation of regulatory capital. In addition, 
        Pillar II requires that the bank maintain its own internal assessment 
        of its risk relative to its capital--both currently and over the cycle 
        as well as in periods of stress--and that the supervisor review 
        and respond to that assessment. The focus is on ensuring that the bank 
        has strong risk-assessment capabilities and that the supervisor and the 
        bank jointly assess and evaluate that capability.

[SECTION]

This kind of dialogue cannot be captured by any set of rules. It will 
        focus on a frank discussion of loss potential and of any unusual capital 
        needs associated with unbundled risks not captured in Pillar I. It addresses 
        the individual bank's special risk profile, its special business strategy--which 
        might, for example, imply geographic or borrower concentrations--or its 
        unique cyclical sensitivities. Such discussion, review, and analysis are 
        focused on the individual bank's possible unique need for a capital buffer--an 
        amount in excess of its Pillar I minimum. Such buffers are designed to 
        minimize the risk that losses and capital erosion could trigger undesired 
        responses under prompt corrective action and the associated reactions 
        that could affect financial and real macroeconomic stability.

[SECTION]

Pillar II, we should be clear, has some drawbacks. It is inherently less 
        transparent than Pillar I because outsiders will not know which portion 
        of a bank's excess capital is deemed "necessary" to address a particular 
        risk specific to the bank and which portion is truly an "extra" cushion. 
        It is also more difficult--although not impossible--for supervisors to 
        require an uncooperative bank to hold Pillar II capital than rule-imposed 
        Pillar I capital.

[SECTION]

Pillar III: Market Disclosure. Basel II seeks 
        to minimize the public difficulty of interpreting capital ratios by requiring 
        public disclosure of considerable quantitative and qualitative information, 
        including, in effect, the risk inputs I described earlier. Such disclosures 
        also provide incentives for banks--the disclosers--to adopt better risk-management 
        techniques and to link their capital requirements to their risk profiles. 
        All these results will enable the public to make comparisons among banks 
        more easily. Indeed, the ability to compare will be an important constraint 
        on any supervisor, foreign or U.S., who might not diligently apply the 
        rules to its banks; outliers will appear unusual and, with insufficient 
        explanation, be subject to market discipline.

[SECTION]

Indeed, a key reason for Pillar III is to seek to harness market discipline 
        to bring pressure on banks to adopt safe and sound practices. Public disclosure 
        increases market discipline in two ways. First, by providing more information, 
        it enables the market to impose differential funding costs and availability 
        on banks, related to the risks they take; additional risk requires additional 
        Pillar I capital, but the disclosure of that risk and the size of the 
        capital buffer also affects the minimum price that counterparties require 
        to provide funding. Second, as noted, it facilitates comparisons across 
        banks. Because outliers will be subject to particularly close review by 
        the market and other national regulators, banks and their regulators will 
        have more difficulty evading their minimum capital requirements.

[SECTION]

Key Issues 
        Not surprisingly with such a significant proposal, some are concerned 
        about certain aspects of Basel II. It might be useful to the subcommittee 
        if, in the remainder of my comments, I focus on a number of issues that 
        have been raised. Before I do, however, I want to reiterate to the subcommittee 
        that the process of developing the Basel II proposals has involved a truly 
        unprecedented dialogue with banks on a wide variety of issues. That dialogue 
        is still going on, especially with regard to technical issues involving 
        retail credit, risk-mitigation techniques, securitization, and other matters, 
        including some that should be called to your attention.

[SECTION]

Operational Risk. One of the early decisions 
        by the participants in the Basel II process was to focus more clearly 
        on credit risk in the capital determination process. Doing so required 
        that all the other risks that had been combined with credit risk in Basel 
        I be unbundled. Several years ago, the first necessary step in the unbundling 
        of these risks was taken when the market risk of trading activities was 
        separated for its own treatment. The Basel II effort has focused very 
        carefully on the credit risks that banks take and has sought to ensure 
        that the framework appropriately measures the marginal contribution of 
        such risks to a bank's total risk profile. But this focus implies the 
        need to consider the way to address other important banking risks. Some 
        of these risks are sufficiently modest that they can be addressed through 
        the supervisory process--Pillar II. But one risk, operational risk, has 
        been historically so important in the depletion of capital and the failure 
        of banks that it should be subject to specific Pillar I minimum capital 
        requirements.

[SECTION]

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate 
        or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events, 
        and it includes legal and compliance-related risks. These risks and their 
        associated losses are often in the news: rogue traders, fraud and forgery, 
        settlement failures, inappropriate sales practices, poor accounting and 
        lapses of control, troubles in acting as custodians and managing assets, 
        and legal settlements involving significant payments for losses alleged 
        to have been caused by banks. All of these costs have been substantial 
        both here and abroad.

[SECTION]

Indeed, many banks, in their internal economic calculations, already 
        allocate a significant portion of their capital for operational risk--averaging 
        17 percent in the subset of large banks we sampled. A couple of banks 
        even make the amount public, and increasingly the market is sensitive 
        to the fact that not all excess regulatory capital is held just as a general 
        buffer, that is, that excess regulatory capital is not necessarily 
        excess economic capital. But the public is unable in most cases 
        to differentiate the excess regulatory capital held for specific purposes 
        from that held for general purposes. This inability is a particular problem 
        under Basel I for those entities with modest credit risk and dominant 
        operating risk. Under Basel I, the regulatory capital is driven solely 
        by credit risk, and therefore the requirement tends to be too low for 
        activities that do not entail much credit risk but do expose the bank 
        to operational risk. The A-IRB banks under Basel II that specialize in 
        such activities--for example, processing securities and payments and acting 
        as custodians--will experience increases in their regulatory 
        capital requirements on those activities. Every day these entities transfer 
        very large amounts of federal funds, act as custodians for massive quantities 
        of securities, and dominate payments and securities transfer systems. 
        Disruptions in their operations can cause, and have caused, serious difficulties 
        in world financial markets.

[SECTION]

U.S. supervisors will propose that those banks that are required, or 
        that choose, to adopt the A-IRB approach to Basel II will also be required 
        to hold capital for operational risk, using a procedure to develop the 
        size of that charge known as the advanced measurement approach (AMA). 
        Because of earlier comments by U.S. bankers, the amount of required operational 
        risk capital will not be subject to a minimum floor nor will the charge 
        be based on revenue. Rather, under the AMA, A-IRB banks themselves will 
        have the primary responsibility for assessing their own operational risk 
        capital requirement. This requirement will be a Pillar I charge and will 
        be disclosed to market participants under Pillar III. The banks that remain 
        under Basel I will not be subject to an operational risk capital charge 
        in the United States.

[SECTION]

The advanced measurement approach gives banks the flexibility to develop 
        their own methodology for calculating the operational, or "op", risk capital 
        charge. The supervisor, to be sure, will require that the procedure be 
        comprehensive, systematic, and consistent with certain broad guidelines. 
        These guidelines specify such factors as the necessity for independent 
        risk management, board and senior management oversight, audits, the use 
        of historical internal and external loss data, scenario analysis, and 
        so forth. The supervisor must review and validate each bank's process, 
        but again considerable flexibility exists for individual bank application. 
        The op risk capital charge is expected to reflect banks' own environment 
        and control mechanisms and can be reduced by insurance and other risk 
        mitigants. For example, if a bank invests in improved contingency procedures 
        and approaches, we would expect such an investment to be reflected in 
        a reduction in the need for operational risk capital under the AMA.

[SECTION]

Several U.S. banks that are developing an op risk capital requirement 
        under the advanced measurement approach have told us that they are very 
        comfortable with the results so far. Importantly, they say that the procedures 
        have allowed them to better identify business activities and practices 
        that pose operational risks and that they have taken steps to minimize 
        the risks. That result is critical to supervisors who believe that the 
        AMA methodology will produce a lasting discipline for banks, encouraging 
        them to think carefully about and minimize the risks associated with their 
        business activities. Supervisors expect the advanced measurement approach 
        to provide the incentives to invest in new systems and practices that 
        will reduce the potential for serious losses from operational risk.

[SECTION]

Operational risk and the AMA are issues that I call to the subcommittee's 
        attention because I am aware of a very few banks that aggressively oppose 
        this aspect of Basel II. Accordingly, I have held a number of discussions 
        with bankers on this subject over the last year, including many direct 
        conversations with the senior bankers who have expressed the most concern 
        about the issue. As I indicated earlier, I believe this sort of dialogue 
        has been essential to the appropriate development of the Basel II framework 
        and is something that we will continue to emphasize. But as a bank supervisor 
        and as a central banker, I have to say that we have not found the arguments 
        of the operational risk skeptics to be convincing.

[SECTION]

The skeptics argue that the cost of developing and using the advanced 
        measurement approach and the associated capital charges divert resources 
        away from actual investment in risk-reducing systems and better backup 
        systems. As I will discuss more fully, Basel II, without doubt, is costly; 
        but the final judgment for any expenditure must rest on the balance between 
        costs and benefits. We and, as noted, many banks believe that the AMA 
        is critical for the kind of formal analysis that focuses banks' attentions 
        on the operational risks they face. We are also convinced that the explicit 
        Pillar I capital charge creates incentives for them to reduce these risks 
        while ensuring that minimum capital is allocated to absorb the remaining 
        risk.

[SECTION]

Critics also argue that an explicit Pillar I capital charge would upset 
        the competitive balance with nonbank and foreign bank competitors. Foreign 
        regulators, it is argued, will be less aggressive in their rule enforcement 
        than U.S. regulators. As I earlier suggested, Pillar III--disclosure--will 
        highlight any significant differences across banks, in the expectation 
        that counterparties will penalize inconsistent risk measures. In addition, 
        the Basel Supervisors Committee has set up an implementation group of 
        senior supervisors to coordinate the application of the rules across countries.

[SECTION]

As for nonbanks, the argument ignores the significant edge banks will 
        continue to have from access to the discount window and the Federal Reserve's 
        payments system. This competitive edge attracts customers and lowers funding 
        costs relative to nonbanks. In addition, most of the banks that have expressed 
        concern about the operational risk capital charge are already carrying 
        large excess regulatory capital positions, supplementing their quite small 
        current regulatory capital. Indeed, we do not believe that these entities 
        would have to raise any new capital to meet the proposed op risk charges, 
        but rather would simply shift excess to required capital. "Excess" regulatory 
        capital may be reduced for some banks under Basel II, but we believe that 
        such reductions because of op risk are perfectly consistent with making 
        capital requirements both more risk sensitive and more transparent, not 
        to mention more accurate.

[SECTION]

The effort not to raise regulatory capital requirements is underlined 
        by the critics' preference that op risk capital needs be addressed in 
        Pillar II--that is, it should be part of the undisclosed capital buffer 
        developed as part of the supervisory oversight of banks on a case-by-case 
        basis. We again disagree. Excess regulatory capital would appear larger 
        than it should, and the transparency of the proposed procedure would be 
        lost. Inevitably, such an approach would treat banks with similar risks 
        differently. Supervisors would also have less leverage over a bank's capital 
        allocation for op risk and third parties would have more difficulty comparing 
        capital among banks than they would under a Pillar I rule.

[SECTION]

In short, we have not been convinced by the arguments we have heard, 
        and we still believe that op risk is every bit as real a risk as credit 
        risk and should be treated in the same way--with an explicit Pillar I 
        capital charge.

[SECTION]

Commercial Real Estate. Some banks--mostly 
        those that would not be subject to the A-IRB capital requirements unless 
        they chose to become so--oppose the higher capital charges that A-IRB 
        banks would generally face on their commercial real estate loans. These 
        banks argue that bank lenders have learned from the losses of the 1980s 
        and early 1990s and now do much better underwriting by insisting on more 
        borrower equity and better appraisal procedures for commercial real estate. 
        These improvements, critics argue, have reduced default rates and losses 
        and, if anything, argue for lower, not higher, capital requirements or 
        at least the same capital charge that is applied to business loans under 
        A-IRB.

[SECTION]

Setting aside that the system has not been tested by a true real estate 
        cycle since the early1990s, the supervisors agree that commercial real 
        estate underwriting has significantly improved. These improvements have 
        been incorporated into the empirical analysis that our staff has used 
        in developing the Basel II proposals. In the view of the Federal Reserve, 
        however, capital requirements should be based on more than just the chance 
        that an individual loan will default: They should also be based on the 
        tendency of defaults to occur at the same time, in "clumps"--what economists 
        refer to as high asset correlation. Defaults and losses occurring in clumps 
        require higher capital than such losses spread out over time. According 
        to our analysis, this clumping tendency is much stronger for commercial 
        real estate credits than for business loans. Moreover, though improvements 
        in underwriting have made individual loans safer, the asset correlations 
        among such loans in a given portfolio--the "clumping" tendency--has not 
        changed as a result of improved underwriting.

[SECTION]

The staff of the Federal Reserve has discussed this issue with bankers 
        and has shown them an analysis--based on several data sets and using different 
        methodologies--requesting their evidence of any errors or new data sets 
        that challenge the staff's conclusion. The Federal Reserve is in the process 
        of making this analysis widely available and is again asking for critical 
        evaluation and any contradictory information. We are, in short, willing 
        to listen. If banks can provide evidence that this proposal embodies erroneous 
        assumptions or is otherwise analytically faulty, we will change it.

[SECTION]

Cost. Implementing A-IRB in this country is 
        going to be expensive for the small number of banks for which it will 
        be required, for those banks choosing it, and for the supervisors. For 
        the banks, the greatest expense is in establishing the mechanisms necessary 
        for a bank to evaluate and control their risk exposures more formally. 
        Nonetheless, such costs are modest relative to the size of recent charge-offs. 
        The A-IRB approach will not eliminate losses: Banks are in the business 
        of taking risk and where there are risks, there will be losses. But we 
        believe that the better risk-management that is required for the A-IRB 
        will reduce losses and provide benefits to bank stakeholders and the economy. 
        The cost-benefit ratio looks right.

[SECTION]

Furthermore, attributing all the costs associated with adopting modern, 
        formal risk-management systems to Basel II is a logical fallacy. The large 
        banks required to adopt A-IRB--banks that must compete for funding in 
        a global marketplace--would ultimately have to undertake such measures 
        with or without Basel II. Basel II may well speed up the adoption process, 
        but many of the costs attributed to Basel II actually just reflect the 
        costs of doing business in an increasingly complex financial environment.

[SECTION]

Competitive Equity. Some regional banks have 
        told us that they are concerned that regional, and perhaps smaller, banks 
        will be competitively disadvantaged by Basel II, even if they are not 
        required to adopt A-IRB. Their concern has two parts.

[SECTION]

First, some regional banks feel that market pressure and the rating agencies 
        will force them to adopt A-IRB and, as a result, to incur significant 
        costs. Our discussions with rating agencies do not support the regional 
        banks' fears. Indeed, our sense is that the rating agencies feel that 
        adoption of A-IRB by regional banks at this time would not be cost effective. 
        In our opinion, any regional bank interested in adopting the A-IRB approach 
        at its inception should carefully assess the costs and benefits of doing 
        so.

[SECTION]

That said, we expect the art and science and, indeed, the very language, 
        of risk management to migrate toward that used for A-IRB. Over the years 
        ahead, as the new risk-management techniques become more cost effective 
        for them, regional banks, we suspect, will adopt these techniques and, 
        thereafter, probably adopt the A-IRB at the regulatory level. But adopting 
        them now would be premature, and we believe that regional banks will not 
        be pressured to do so by either the rating agencies or the regulators.

[SECTION]

The second part of the competitive equity concern is the belief by some 
        regional and community banks that they will be placed at a competitive 
        disadvantage with A-IRB banks because of the larger banks' lower regulatory 
        capital charges on residential mortgages, loans to smaller businesses, 
        and certain retail loans.

[SECTION]

The direct competitive impact on Basel II and Basel I banks is important. 
        Of course, the rulemaking process in the United States will probe the 
        issue fully. However, a number of factors suggest that the concern about 
        competitive impact is not well founded.

[SECTION]

In terms of overall capital, A-IRB banks will likely face lower 
        capital charges for some types of lending, but they will also face higher 
        charges on other loan categories, such as commercial real estate finance 
        and higher costs of developing the risk-management infrastructure to be 
        an A-IRB bank. They will also be subject to an explicit capital charge 
        for operational risk and the cyclical buffer in Pillar II that will not 
        be imposed on non-IRB banks.

[SECTION]

In the individual loan markets for which Basel II lowers A-IRB 
        capital charges, we also have reason to believe that competitive balance 
        will not be disrupted. In the business loan market, for example, the smallest 
        banks do not directly compete with the banks that will be required to 
        adopt A-IRB. Small banks' close ties to local communities afford them 
        substantial information advantages over larger banks. As a result, they 
        tend to focus on relationship lending to small businesses and individuals. 
        A-IRB banks, in contrast, tend to make such retail loans by using automated 
        underwriting tools. Larger regional banks are more likely to compete directly 
        with A-IRB banks, but for two good reasons we believe that Basel II will 
        not affect these banks significantly.

[SECTION]

First, today not regulatory capital but economic capital--the individual 
        bank's management judgment about internal capital allocations for its 
        own decisionmaking--drives loan pricing and origination decisions. Nothing 
        in Basel II will change for the capital charges implied by economic capital. 
        Moreover, for some years, as I discussed earlier, when there has been 
        a difference between regulatory and economic capital, sophisticated banks 
        have used capital arbitrage techniques to reduce their effective regulatory 
        minimums. Asset securitization deals, in particular, have allowed banks 
        to dramatically reduce the amount of capital they currently hold for residential 
        mortgages and many retail loans. Regulatory capital arbitrage--market 
        reality--thus has already reduced the effective capital charge for the 
        loans for which A-IRB banks will receive lower on-balance capital charges. 
        Basel II increases transparency by bringing regulatory minimums more in 
        line with reality, but it will not change the status quo competitive 
        environment very much, if at all. In short, Basel II will bring A-IRB 
        banks' regulatory capital charges more in line with the capital charges 
        they have, through arbitrage, already obtained.

[SECTION]

The second reason minimum regulatory capital requirements are unlikely 
        to significantly affect competitive behavior is that most well managed 
        banks carry sizable excess capital buffers. Smaller banks in particular, 
        operating with less leverage than larger banks, hold substantial excess 
        regulatory capital, which reflects their lack of diversification and more 
        limited access to funding. Basel II will not change that fact. Under Basel 
        II, small banks will continue to hold more capital than A-IRB banks, but 
        A-IRB banks' true risk-based capital positions will be measured more accurately.

[SECTION]

Conclusion 
        The Basel II effort reflects the collective judgment of the supervisors 
        of the world's largest and most complex banking organizations, including 
        those of the United States, that the activities and practices of such 
        firms have been outgrowing our existing supervisory approaches. At the 
        same time, the role of these banks in our financial systems continues 
        to grow. In my judgment, we have no alternative but to adopt, as soon 
        as practical, approaches that are appropriately suited to the task of 
        bank supervision of our larger banks in the twenty-first century.

[SECTION]

The Basel II framework is the product of extensive multiyear dialogues 
        with the banking industry regarding state-of-the-art risk-management practices 
        in every significant area of banking activity. Accordingly, it provides 
        a roadmap for the improved regulation and supervision of global banking. 
        Basel II will provide strong incentives for banks to continue improving 
        their internal risk-management capabilities as well as the tools for supervisors 
        to focus on emerging problems and issues more rapidly than ever before.

[SECTION]

I am pleased to appear before you today to report on this effort as it 
        nears completion. Open discussion of complex issues has been at the heart 
        of the Basel II development process from the outset and no doubt will 
        continue to characterize it as Basel II evolves further.
