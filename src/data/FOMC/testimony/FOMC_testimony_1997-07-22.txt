Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan
The Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report
Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate 
July 22, 1997

[SECTION]

I am pleased to appear before this
          Subcommittee to present the Federal Reserve's
          report on the economic situation and monetary
          policy.

[SECTION]

The recent performance of the economy,
          characterized by strong growth and low
          inflation, has been exceptional--and better
          than most anticipated.  During the first
          quarter of 1997, real gross domestic product
          expanded at nearly a 6 percent annual rate,
          after posting a 3 percent increase over 1996.
          Activity apparently continued to expand in
          the second quarter, albeit at a more moderate
          pace.  The economy is now in the seventh
          consecutive year of expansion, making it the
          third longest post-World War II cyclical
          upswing to date.

[SECTION]

Moreover, our Federal Reserve Banks
          indicate that economic activity is on the
          rise, and at a relatively high level, in
          virtually every geographic region and
          community of the nation.  The expansion has
          been balanced, in that inventories, as well
          as stocks of business capital and other
          durable assets, have been kept closely in
          line with spending, so overhangs have been
          small and readily corrected.

[SECTION]

This strong expansion has produced a
          remarkable increase in work opportunities for
          Americans.  A net of more than thirteen
          million jobs has been created since the
          current period of growth began in the spring
          of 1991.  As a consequence, the unemployment
          rate has fallen to 5 percent--its lowest
          level in almost a quarter century.  The
          expansion has enabled many in the working-age
          population, a large number of whom would have
          otherwise remained out of the labor force or
          among the longer-term unemployed, to acquire
          work experience and improved skills.  Our
          whole economy will benefit from their greater
          productivity.  To be sure, not all segments
          of our population are fully sharing in the
          economic improvement.  Some Americans still
          have trouble finding jobs, and for part of
          our work force real wage stagnation persists.

[SECTION]

In contrast to the typical postwar
          business cycle, measured price inflation is
          lower now than when the expansion began and
          has shown little tendency to rebound of late,
          despite high rates of resource utilization.
          In the business sector, producer prices have
          fallen in each of the past six months.
          Consumers also are enjoying low inflation.
          The consumer price index rose at less than a
          2 percent annual rate over the first half of
          the year, down from a little over 3 percent
          in 1996.

[SECTION]

With the economy performing so well for
          so long, financial markets have been buoyant,
          as memories of past business and financial
          cycles fade with time.  Soaring prices in the
          stock market have been fueled by moderate
          long-term interest rates and expectations of
          investors that profit margins and earnings
          growth will hold steady, or even increase
          further, in a relatively stable,
          low-inflation environment.  Credit spreads at
          depository institutions and in the open
          market have remained extremely narrow by
          historical standards, suggesting a high
          degree of confidence among lenders regarding
          the prospects for credit repayment.

[SECTION]

The key questions facing financial
          markets and policymakers are What is behind
          the good performance of the economy and Will
          it persist.  Without question, the
          exceptional economic situation reflects some
          temporary factors that have been restraining
          inflation rates.  In addition, however,
          important pieces of information, while just
          suggestive at this point, could be read as
          indicating basic improvements in the longer-term efficiency of our economy.  The Federal
          Reserve has been aware of this possibility in
          our monetary policy deliberations and, as
          always, has operated with a view to supplying
          adequate liquidity to allow the economy to
          reach its highest potential on a sustainable
          basis.

[SECTION]

Nonetheless, we also recognize that the
          capacity of our economy to produce goods and
          services is not without limit.  If demand
          were to outrun supply, inflationary
          imbalances would eventually develop that
          would tend to undermine the current expansion
          and inhibit the long-run growth potential of
          the economy.  Because monetary policy works
          with a significant lag, policy actions are
          directed at a future that may not be clearly
          evident in current experience.  This leads to
          policy judgments that are by their nature
          calibrated to the relative probabilities of
          differing outcomes.  We moved the federal
          funds rate higher in March because we
          perceived the probability of demand
          outstripping supply to have increased to a
          point where inaction would have put at risk
          the solid elements of support that have
          sustained this expansion and made it so
          beneficial.

[SECTION]

In making such judgments in March and in
          the future, we need to analyze carefully the
          various forces that may be affecting the
          balance of supply and demand in the economy,
          including those that may be responsible for
          its exceptional recent behavior.  The
          remainder of my testimony will address the
          various possibilities.

[SECTION]

Inflation, Output, and Technological Change
          in the 1990s

[SECTION]

Many observers, including us, have been
          puzzled about how an economy, operating at
          high levels and drawing into employment
          increasingly less experienced workers, can
          still produce subdued and, by some measures
          even falling, inflation rates.  It will,
          doubtless, be several years before we know
          with any conviction the full story of the
          surprisingly benign combination of output and
          prices that has marked the business expansion
          of the last six years.

[SECTION]

Certainly, public policy has played an
          important role.  Administration and
          Congressional actions to curtail budget
          deficits have enabled long-term interest
          rates to move lower, encouraging private
          efficiency-enhancing capital investment.
          Deregulation in a number of industries has
          fostered competition and held down prices.
          Finally, the preemptive actions of the
          Federal Reserve in 1994 contained a
          potentially destabilizing surge in demand,
          short-circuiting a boom-bust business cycle
          in the making and keeping inflation low to
          encourage business innovation.  But the
          fuller explanation of the recent
          extraordinary performance may well lie
          deeper.

[SECTION]

In February 1996, I raised before this
          Committee a hypothesis tying together
          technological change and cost pressures that
          could explain what was even then a puzzling
          quiescence of inflation.  The new information
          received in the last eighteen months remains
          consistent with those earlier notions;
          indeed, some additional pieces of the puzzle
          appear to be falling into place.

[SECTION]

A surge in capital investment in high
          tech equipment that began in early 1993 has
          since strengthened.  Purchases of computer
          and telecommunications equipment have risen
          at a more than 14 percent annual rate since
          early 1993 in nominal terms, and at an
          astonishing rate of nearly 25 percent in real
          terms, reflecting the fall in the prices of
          this equipment.  Presumably companies have
          come to perceive a significant increase in
          profit opportunities from exploiting the
          improved productivity of these new
          technologies.

[SECTION]

It is premature to judge definitively
          whether these business perceptions are the
          harbinger of a more general and persistent
          improvement in productivity.  Supporting this
          possibility, productivity growth, which often
          suffers as business expansions mature, has
          not followed that pattern.  In addition,
          profit margins remain high in the face of
          pickups in compensation growth, suggesting
          that businesses continue to find new ways to
          enhance their efficiency.  Nonetheless,
          although the anecdotal evidence is ample and
          manufacturing productivity has picked up, a
          change in the underlying trend is not yet
          reflected in our conventional data for the
          whole economy.

[SECTION]

But even if the perceived quicker pace
          of application of our newer technologies
          turns out to be mere wheel-spinning rather
          than true productivity advance, it has
          brought with it a heightened sense of job
          insecurity and, as a consequence, subdued
          wage gains.  As I pointed out here last
          February, polls indicated that despite the
          significant fall in the unemployment rate,
          the proportion of workers in larger
          establishments fearful of being laid off rose
          from 25 percent in 1991 to 46 percent by
          1996.  It should not have been surprising
          then that strike activity in the 1990s has
          been lower than it has been in decades and
          that new labor union contracts have been
          longer and have given greater emphasis to job
          security.  Nor should it have been unexpected
          that the number of workers voluntarily
          leaving their jobs to seek other employment
          has not risen in this period of tight labor
          markets.

[SECTION]

To be sure, since last year, surveys
          have indicated that the proportion of workers
          fearful of layoff has stabilized and the
          number of voluntary job leavers has edged up.
          And, indeed, perhaps as a consequence, wage
          gains have accelerated some.  But increases
          in the Employment Cost Index still trail
          behind what previous relationships to tight
          labor markets would have suggested, and a
          lingering sense of fear or uncertainty seems
          still to pervade the job market, though to a
          somewhat lesser extent.

[SECTION]

Consumer surveys do indicate greater
          optimism about the economy.  However, it is
          one thing to believe that the economy, indeed
          the job market, will do well overall, but
          quite another to feel secure about one's
          individual situation, given the accelerated
          pace of corporate restructuring and the
          heightened fear of skill obsolescence that
          has apparently characterized this expansion.
          Persisting insecurity would help explain why
          measured personal saving rates have not
          declined as would have been expected from the
          huge increase in stock market wealth.  We
          will, however, have a better fix on savings
          rates after the coming benchmark revisions to
          the national income and product accounts.

[SECTION]

The combination in recent years of
          subdued compensation per hour and solid
          productivity advances has meant that unit
          labor costs of nonfinancial corporations have
          barely moved.  Moreover, when you combine
          unit labor costs with nonlabor costs -- which
          account for one-quarter of total costs on a
          consolidated basis -- total unit costs for
          the year ended in the first quarter of 1997
          rose only about half a percent.  Hence, a
          significant part of the measured price
          increase over that period was attributable to
          a rise in profit margins, unusual well into
          a business expansion.  Rising margins are
          further evidence suggesting that productivity
          gains have been unexpectedly strong; in these
          situations, real labor compensation usually
          catches up only with a lag.

[SECTION]

While accelerated technological change
          may well be an important element in
          unraveling the current economic puzzle, there
          have been other influences at play as well in
          restraining price increases at high levels of
          resource utilization.  The strong dollar of
          the last two years has pared import prices
          and constrained the pricing behavior of
          domestic firms facing import competition.
          Increasing globalization has enabled greater
          specialization over a wider array of goods
          and services, in effect allowing comparative
          advantage to hold down costs and enhance
          efficiencies.  Increased deregulation of
          telecommunications, motor and rail transport,
          utilities, and finance doubtless has been a
          factor restraining prices, as perhaps has the
          reduced market power of labor unions.
          Certainly, changes in the health care
          industry and the pricing of health services
          have greatly contributed to holding down
          growth in the cost of benefits, and hence
          overall labor compensation.

[SECTION]

Many of these forces are limited or
          temporary, and their effects can be expected
          to diminish, at which time cost and price
          pressures would tend to reemerge. The effects
          of an increased rate of technological change
          might be more persistent, but they too could
          not permanently hold down inflation if the
          Federal Reserve allows excess liquidity to
          flood financial markets.  I have noted to you
          before the likelihood that at some point
          workers might no longer be willing to
          restrain wage gains for added security, at
          which time accelerating unit labor costs
          could begin to press on profit margins and
          prices, should monetary policy be too
          accommodative.

[SECTION]

When I discuss greater technological
          change, I am not referring primarily to a
          particular new invention.  Instead, I have in
          mind the increasingly successful and
          pervasive application of recent technological
          advances, especially in telecommunications
          and computers, to enhance efficiencies in
          production processes throughout the economy.
          Many of these technologies have been around
          for some time.  Why might they be having a
          more pronounced effect now?

[SECTION]

In an intriguing paper prepared for a
          conference last year sponsored by the Federal
          Reserve Bank of Boston, Professor Nathan
          Rosenberg of Stanford documented how, in the
          past, it often took a considerable period of
          time for the necessary synergies to develop
          between different forms of capital and
          technologies.  One example is the invention
          of the dynamo in the mid 1800s.  Rosenberg's
          colleague Professor Paul David had noted a
          number of years ago that it wasn't until the
          1920s that critical complementary
          technologies of the dynamo -- for example,
          the electric motor as the primary source of
          mechanical drive in factories, and central
          generating stations -- were developed and in
          place and that production processes had fully
          adapted to these inventions.

[SECTION]

What we may be observing in the current
          environment is a number of key technologies,
          some even mature, finally interacting to
          create significant new opportunities for
          value creation.  For example, the
          applications for the laser were modest until
          the later development of fiber optics
          engendered a revolution in
          telecommunications.  Broad advances in
          software have enabled us to capitalize on the
          prodigious gains in hardware capacity.  The
          interaction of both of these has created the
          Internet.

[SECTION]

The accelerated synergies of the various
          technologies may be what have been creating
          the apparent significant new profit
          opportunities that presumably lie at the root
          of the recent boom in high-tech investment.
          An expected result of the widespread and
          effective application of information and
          other technologies would be a significant
          increase in productivity and reduction in
          business costs.

[SECTION]

We do not now know, nor do I suspect can
          anyone know, whether current developments are
          part of a once or twice in a century
          phenomenon that will carry productivity
          trends nationally and globally to a new
          higher track, or whether we are merely
          observing some unusual variations within the
          context of an otherwise generally
          conventional business cycle expansion.  The
          recent improvement in productivity could be
          just transitory, an artifact of a temporary
          surge in demand and output growth.  In view
          of the slowing in growth in the second
          quarter and the more moderate expansion
          widely expected going forward, data for
          profit margins on domestic operations and
          productivity from the second quarter on will
          be especially relevant in assessing whether
          recent improvements are structural or
          cyclical.

[SECTION]

Whatever the trend in productivity and,
          by extension, overall sustainable economic
          growth, from the Federal Reserve's point of
          view, the faster the better.  We see our job
          as fostering the degree of liquidity that
          will best support the most effective platform
          for growth to flourish.  We believe a
          noninflationary environment is such a
          platform because it promotes long-term
          planning and capital investment and keeps the
          pressure on businesses to contain costs and
          enhance efficiency.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve's policy problem is
          not with growth, but with maintaining an
          effective platform.  To do so, we endeavor to
          prevent strains from developing in our
          economic system, which long experience tells
          us produce bottlenecks, shortages, and
          inefficiencies.  These eventually create more
          inflation, which undermines economic
          expansion and limits the longer-term
          potential of the economy.

[SECTION]

In gauging the potential for oncoming
          strains, it is the effective capacity of the
          economy to produce that is important to us.
          An economy operating at a high level of
          utilization and growing 5 percent a year is
          in little difficulty if capacity is growing
          at least that fast.  But a fully utilized
          economy growing at 1 percent will eventually
          get into trouble if capacity is growing less
          than that.

[SECTION]

Capacity itself, however, is a complex
          concept, which requires a separate evaluation
          of its two components, capital and labor.  It
          appears that capital, that is, plant and
          equipment, can adapt and expand more
          expeditiously than in the past to meet
          demands.  Hence, capital capacity is now a
          considerably less rigid constraint than it
          once was.

[SECTION]

In recent years, technology has
          engendered a significant compression of lead
          times between order and delivery for
          production facilities.  This has enabled
          output to respond increasingly faster to an
          upsurge in demand, thereby decreasing the
          incidence of strains on capital capacity and
          shortages so evident in earlier business
          expansions.

[SECTION]

Reflecting progressively shorter lead
          times for capital equipment, unfilled orders
          to shipment ratios for nondefense capital
          goods have declined by 30 percent in the last
          six years.  Not only do producers have
          quicker access to equipment that embodies the
          most recent advances, but they have been able
          to adjust their overall capital stock more
          rapidly to increases in demand.

[SECTION]

The current lack of material shortages
          and bottlenecks, despite the high level and
          recent robust expansion of demand, is
          striking.  The effective capacity of
          production facilities has increased
          substantially in recent years in response to
          strong final demands and the influence of
          cost reductions possible with the newer
          technologies.  Increased flexibility is
          particularly evident in the computer,
          telecommunications, and related industries, a
          segment of our economy that seems far less
          subject to physical capacity constraints than
          many older-line establishments, and one that
          is assuming greater importance in our overall
          output.  But the shortening of lags has been
          pervasive even in more mature industries,
          owing in part to the application of advanced
          technologies to production methods.

[SECTION]

At the extreme, if all capital goods
          could be produced at constant cost and on
          demand, the size of our nation's capital
          stock would never pose a restraint on
          production.  We are obviously very far from
          that nirvana, but it is important to note
          that we are also far from the situation a
          half-century ago when our production
          processes were dominated by equipment such as
          open hearth steel furnaces, which had very
          exacting limits on how much they could
          produce in a fixed time frame and which
          required huge lead times to expand their
          capacity.

[SECTION]

Even so, today's economy as a whole
          still can face capacity constraints from its
          facilities.  Indeed, just three years ago,
          bottlenecks in industrial production --
          though less extensive than in years past at
          high levels of measured capacity utilization
          -- were nonetheless putting significant
          upward pressures on prices at earlier stages
          of production.  More recently vendor
          performance has deteriorated somewhat,
          indicating that flexibility to meet demands
          still has limits.  Although further strides
          toward greater facilities flexibility have
          occurred since 1994, this is clearly an
          evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.

[SECTION]

Labor Markets

[SECTION]

Moreover, technology and management
          changes have had only a limited effect on the
          ability of labor supply to respond to changes
          in demand.  To be sure, individual firms have
          acquired additional flexibility by increased
          use of outsourcing and temporary workers.  In
          addition, smaller work teams can adapt more
          readily to variations in order flows.  While
          these techniques put the right workers at the
          right spots to reduce bottlenecks, they do
          not increase the aggregate supply of labor.
          That supply is sensitive to changes in
          demand, but to a far more limited extent than
          for facilities.  New plants can almost always
          be built.  But labor capacity for an
          individual country is constrained by the size
          of the working-age population, which, except
          for immigration, is basically determined
          several decades in the past.

[SECTION]

Of course, capital facilities and labor
          are not fully separate markets.  Within
          limits, labor and capital are substitutes,
          and slack in one market can offset tightness
          in another.  For example, additional work
          shifts can expand output without significant
          addition to facilities, and similarly more
          labor-displacing equipment can permit
          production to be increased with the same
          level of employment.

[SECTION]

Yet despite significant increases in
          capital equipment in recent years, new
          additions to labor supply have been
          inadequate to meet the demand for labor.  As
          a consequence, the recent period has been one
          of significant reduction in labor market
          slack.

[SECTION]

Of the more than two million net new
          hires at an annual rate since early 1994,
          only about half have come from an expansion
          in the population aged 16 to 64 who wanted a
          job, and more than a third of those were net
          new immigrants.  The remaining one million
          plus per year increase in employment has been
          pulled from those who had been reported as
          unemployed (600 thousand annually) and those
          who wanted, but had not actively sought, a
          job (more than 400 thousand annually).  The
          latter, of course, are not in the official
          unemployment count.

[SECTION]

The key point is that continuously
          digging ever deeper into the available work
          age population is not a sustainable
          trajectory for job creation.  The
          unemployment rate has a downside limit if for
          no other reason than unemployment, in part,
          reflects voluntary periods of job search and
          other frictional unemployment.  There is also
          a limit on how many of the additional 5
          million who wanted a job last quarter but
          were not actively seeking one could be
          readily absorbed into jobs -- in particular,
          the large number enrolled in school, and
          those who may lack the necessary skills or
          face other barriers to taking jobs.  The rise
          in the average workweek since early 1996
          suggests employers are having increasingly
          greater difficulty fitting the millions who
          want a job into available job slots.  If the
          pace of job creation continues, the pressures
          on wages and other costs of hiring increasing
          numbers of such individuals could escalate
          more rapidly.

[SECTION]

To be sure, there remain an additional
          34 million in the working-age population (age
          16 - 64) who say they do not want a job.
          Presumably, some of these early retirees,
          students, or homemakers might be attracted to
          the job market if it became sufficiently
          rewarding.  However, making it attractive
          enough could also involve upward pressures in
          real wages that would trigger renewed price
          pressures, undermining the expansion.

[SECTION]

Thus, there would seem to be emerging
          constraints on potential labor input.  Even
          before we reach the ultimate limit of
          sustainable labor supply growth, the
          economy's ability to expand employment at the
          recent rate should rapidly diminish.  The
          availability of unemployed labor could no
          longer add to growth, irrespective of the
          degree of slack in physical facilities at
          that time.  Simply adding new facilities will
          not increase production unless output per
          worker improves.  Such improvements are
          possible if worker skills increase, but such
          gains come slowly through improved education
          and on-the-job training.  They are also
          possible as capital substitutes for labor,
          but are limited by the state of technology.
          More significant advances require
          technological breakthroughs.  At the cutting
          edge of technology, where America finds
          itself, major improvements cannot be produced
          on demand.  New ideas that matter are hard
          won.

[SECTION]

The Economic Outlook

[SECTION]

As I noted, the recent performance of
          the labor markets suggests that the economy
          was on an unsustainable track.  Unless
          aggregate demand increases more slowly than
          it has in recent years -- more in line with
          trends in the supply of labor and
          productivity -- imbalances will emerge.  We
          do not know, however, at what point pressures
          would develop -- or indeed whether the
          economy is already close to that point.

[SECTION]

Fortunately, the very rapid growth of
          demand over the winter has eased recently.
          To an extent this easing seems to reflect
          some falloff in growth of demand for consumer
          durables and for inventories to a pace more
          in line with moderate expansion in income.
          But some of the recent slower growth could
          simply be a product of abnormal weather
          patterns, which contributed to a
          first-quarter surge in output and weakened
          the second quarter, in which case the
          underlying trend could be somewhat higher
          than suggested by the second-quarter data
          alone.  Certainly, business and consumer
          confidence remains high and financial
          conditions are supportive of growth.
          Particularly notable is the run-up in stock
          market wealth, the full effects of which
          apparently have not been reflected in overall
          demand, but might yet be.

[SECTION]

Monetary policymakers, balancing these
          various forces, forecast a continuation of
          less rapid growth in coming quarters.  For
          1997 as a whole, the central tendency of
          their forecasts has real GDP growing 3 to
          3-1/4 percent.  This would be much more brisk
          than was anticipated in February, and the
          upward revision to this estimate largely
          reflects the unexpectedly strong first
          quarter.  The central tendency of monetary
          policymakers' projections is that real GDP
          will expand 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 1998.  This
          pace of expansion is expected to keep the
          unemployment rate close to its current low
          level.

[SECTION]

We are reasonably confident that
          inflation will be quite modest for 1997 as a
          whole.  The central tendency of the forecasts
          is that consumer prices will rise only 2-1/4
          to 2-1/2 percent this year.  This would be a
          significantly better outcome than the 2-3/4
          to 3 percent CPI inflation foreseen in
          February.

[SECTION]

Federal Open Market Committee members do
          see higher rates of inflation next year.  The
          central tendency of the projections is that
          CPI inflation will be 2-1/2 to 3 percent in
          1998 -- a little above the expectation for
          this year.  However, much of this increase is
          presumed to result from the absence of
          temporary factors that are holding down
          inflation this year.  In particular, the
          favorable movements in food and energy prices
          of 1997 are unlikely to be repeated, and
          non-oil import prices may not continue to
          decline.  While it is possible that better
          productivity trends and subdued wage growth
          will continue to help damp the increases in
          business costs associated with tight labor
          markets, this is a situation that the Federal
          Reserve plans to monitor closely.

[SECTION]

I have no doubt that the current stance
          of policy -- characterized by a nominal
          federal funds rate around 5-1/2 percent --
          will need to be changed at some point to
          foster sustainable growth and low inflation.
          Adjustments in the policy instrument in
          response to new information are a necessary
          and, I should like to emphasize, routine
          aspect of responsible policymaking.  For the
          present, as I indicated, demand growth does
          appear to have moderated, but whether that
          moderation will be sufficient to avoid
          putting additional pressures on resources is
          an open question.  With considerable momentum
          behind the expansion and labor market
          utilization rates unusually high, the Federal
          Reserve must be alert to the possibility that
          additional action might be called for to
          forestall excessive credit creation.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve is intent on gearing
          its policy to facilitate the maximum
          sustainable growth of the economy, but it is
          not, as some commentators have suggested,
          involved in an experiment that deliberately
          prods the economy to see how far and fast it
          can grow.  The costs of a failed experiment
          would be much too burdensome for too many of
          our citizens.

[SECTION]

Clearly, in considering issues of
          monetary policy we need to distinguish
          carefully between sustainable economic growth
          and unsustainable accelerations of activity.
          Sustainable growth reflects the increased
          capacity of the economic system to produce
          goods and services over the longer run.  It
          is largely the sum of increases in
          productivity and in the labor force.  That
          growth contrasts with a second type, a more
          transitory growth.  An economy producing near
          capacity can expand faster for a short time,
          often through unsustainably low short-term
          interest rates and excess credit creation.
          But this is not growth that promotes lasting
          increases in standards of living and in jobs
          for our nation.  Rather, it is a growth that
          creates instability and thereby inhibits the
          achievement of our nation's economic goals.

[SECTION]

The key question is how monetary policy
          can best foster the highest rate of
          sustainable growth and avoid amplifying
          swings in output, employment, and prices.
          The historical evidence is unambiguous that
          excessive creation of credit and liquidity
          contributes nothing to the long-run growth of
          our productive potential and much to costly
          shorter-term fluctuations.  Moreover, it
          promotes inflation, impairing the economy's
          longer-term potential output.

[SECTION]

Our objective has never been to contain
          inflation as an end in itself, but rather as
          a precondition for the highest possible
          long-run growth of output and income -- the
          ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy.

[SECTION]

In considering possible adjustments of
          policy to achieve that goal, the issue of
          lags in the effects of monetary policy is
          crucial.  The evidence clearly demonstrates
          that monetary policy affects the financial
          markets immediately but works with
          significant lags on output, employment, and
          prices.  Thus, as I pointed out earlier,
          policy needs to be made today on the basis of
          likely economic conditions in the future.  As
          a consequence, and in the absence of
          once-reliable monetary guides to policy,
          there is no alternative to formulating policy
          using risk-reward tradeoffs based on what
          are, unavoidably, uncertain forecasts.

[SECTION]

Operating on uncertain forecasts, of
          course, is not unusual.  People do it every
          day, consciously or subconsciously.  A driver
          might tap the brakes to make sure not to be
          hit by a truck coming down the street, even
          if he thinks the chances of such an event are
          relatively low; the costs of being wrong are
          simply too high.  Similarly, in conducting
          monetary policy the Federal Reserve needs
          constantly to look down the road to gauge the
          future risks to the economy and act
          accordingly.

[SECTION]

Growth of Money and Credit

[SECTION]

The view that the Federal Reserve's best
          contribution to growth is to foster price
          stability has informed both our tactical
          decisions on the stance of monetary policy
          and our longer-run judgments on appropriate
          rates of liquidity provision.  To be sure,
          growth rates of monetary and credit
          aggregates have become less reliable as
          guides for monetary policy as a result of
          rapid change in our financial system.  As I
          have reported to you previously, the current
          uncertainties regarding the behavior of the
          monetary aggregates have implied that we have
          been unable to employ them as guides to
          short-run policy decisions.  Accordingly, in
          recent years we have reported annual ranges
          for money growth that serve as benchmarks
          under conditions of price stability and a
          return to historically stable patterns of
          velocity.

[SECTION]

Over the past several years, the
          monetary aggregates -- M2 in particular --
          have shown some signs of reestablishing such
          stable patterns.  The velocity of M2 has
          fluctuated in a relatively narrow range, and
          some of its variation within that range has
          been explained by interest rate movements, in
          a relationship similar to that established
          over earlier decades.  We find this an
          encouraging development, and it is possible
          that at some point the FOMC might elect to
          put more weight on such monetary quantities
          in the conduct of policy.  But in our view,
          sufficient evidence has not yet accumulated
          to support such a judgment.

[SECTION]

Consequently, we have decided to keep
          the existing ranges of growth for money and
          credit for 1997 and carry them over to next
          year, retaining the interpretation of the
          money ranges as benchmarks for the
          achievement of price stability.  With nominal
          income growth strong relative to the rate
          that would likely prevail under conditions of
          price stability, the growth of M2 is likely
          to run in the upper part of its range both
          this year and next, while M3 could run a
          little above its cone.  Domestic nonfinancial
          sector debt is likely to remain well within
          its range, with private debt growth brisk and
          federal debt growth subdued.  Although any
          tendency for the aggregates to exceed their
          ranges would not, in the event, necessarily
          call for an examination of whether a policy
          adjustment was needed, the Federal Reserve
          will be closely examining financial market
          prices and flows in the context of a broad
          range of economic and price indicators for
          evidence that the sustainability of the
          economic expansion may be in jeopardy.

[SECTION]

Concluding Comment

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve recognizes, of
          course, that monetary policy does not
          determine the economy's potential.  All that
          it can do is help establish sound money and a
          stable financial environment in which the
          inherent vitality of a market economy can
          flourish and promote the capital investment
          that in the long run is the basis for
          vigorous economic growth.  Similarly, other
          government policies also have a major role to
          play in contributing to economic growth.  A
          continued emphasis on market mechanisms
          through deregulation will help sharpen
          incentives to work, save, invest, and
          innovate.  Similarly, a fiscal policy
          oriented toward limited growth in government
          expenditures, producing smaller budget
          deficits and even budget surpluses, would
          tend to lower real interest rates even
          further, also promoting capital investment.
          The recent experience provides striking
          evidence of the potential for the
          continuation and extension of monetary,
          fiscal, and structural policies to enhance
          our economy's performance in the period
          ahead.
