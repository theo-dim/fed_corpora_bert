Mr. Chairman and other members of the committee, I am pleased to be 
        here today to discuss the economic effects of the aging of the global 
        population. In so doing, I would like to emphasize that the views I will 
        express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal 
        Reserve Board.

[SECTION]

The world's population is growing older as a result of both declining 
        fertility and increasing life expectancy. These trends manifest themselves 
        in at least two important dimensions: a more slowly growing population 
        and labor force, and an increase in the ratio of the elderly to the working-age 
        population.

[SECTION]

The so-called elderly dependency ratio has been rising in the industrialized 
        world for at least 150 years. The pace of increase slowed greatly with 
        the birth of the baby-boom generation after World War II. But elderly 
        dependency will almost certainly rise more rapidly as that generation 
        reaches retirement age. The acceleration will be particularly dramatic 
        in Japan and Europe. For example, in Japan the population share of the 
        elderly, defined here as those at least 65 years of age, climbed from 
        12 percent to 17 percent in the past decade, and demographers expect it 
        to reach 30 percent by 2030. The absolute size of Japan's working-age 
        population is already declining and is projected to fall 20 percent over 
        the next three decades. Europe's working-age population is also anticipated 
        to recede, and the share of the elderly in its overall population is expected 
        to rise markedly, though less so than in Japan.

[SECTION]

The changes projected for the United States are not so severe as those 
        projected for Europe and Japan, but nonetheless present daunting challenges. 
        Over the next thirty years, the growth rate of the working-age population 
        in the United States is anticipated to slow, from about 1 percent per 
        year today to about 1/2 percent per year by 2030. At the same time, the 
        percentage of the population that is over 65 will rise markedly--from 
        less than 13 percent today to perhaps 20 percent by 2030.

[SECTION]

Though the overall population is expected to continue to age, much of 
        the aging of the labor force has already occurred with the aging of the 
        baby-boom generation. Once the baby boomers begin to retire, the mean 
        age of the U.S. labor force is expected to stabilize.

[SECTION]

These anticipated changes in the age structure of our population and 
        work force result largely from the decline in fertility that occurred 
        following the birth of the baby-boom generation. After peaking in 1957 
        at about 3-1/2 births over a woman's lifetime, the fertility rate in the 
        United States fell to less than 2 by the early 1970s, and then rose to 
        about 2.1 by 1990.1  Since then, the fertility rate has remained close to 
        2.1, the so-called replacement rate, or the level required to hold the 
        population constant in the absence of immigration or changes in longevity. 
        The decrease in the number of children per family since the baby boom 
        has inevitably led, with a lag, to a projected increase in the ratio of 
        elderly to working-age population.

[SECTION]

Increases in life expectancy, too, have been substantial. In 1950, a 
        man 65 years of age could expect, on average, to live until age 78, whereas 
        now he can expect to live until over 81. And if current trends continue, 
        by 2025 he can expect to live to 83 and, by 2060, to 85. Women's life 
        expectancy is projected to increase about the same amount, from 81 in 
        1950 to roughly 85 today, 86 in 2025 and 88 in 2060.

[SECTION]

Of course, it is difficult to predict the age structure of the population 
        in the more distant future. Although we have a good idea of the size of 
        the working-age population over the next twenty years or so--its members 
        are largely already born--forecasting the number of children and future 
        immigration and population growth is much more conjectural. Just recently, 
        for example, the United Nations revised its forecast of world fertility 
        rates downward from its projection only three years earlier; according 
        to the new forecast, world population is expected to begin actually declining 
        in the latter part of this century, whereas under the previous forecast, 
        it was expected to continue growing.

[SECTION]

Even with the substantial uncertainty that surrounds these forecasts, 
        population aging in the developed world is not likely to be a temporary 
        phenomenon, associated solely with the retirement of the baby-boom generation. 
        Rather, under current projections, the retirement of that generation should 
        be viewed as hastening the transition between the current distribution 
        of age and one in which the population is notably older.

[SECTION]

The populations in most developing countries likewise are expected to 
        have a rising median age, but they will remain significantly younger and 
        grow faster than our population over the foreseeable future. Eventually, 
        declines in fertility rates and increases in longevity may lead to similar 
        issues with aging populations in the developing world but likely only 
        well after the demographic transition in the United States.

[SECTION]

As you know, the aging of the population in the United States will have 
        significant effects on our fiscal situation. In particular, it makes our 
        social security and Medicare programs unsustainable in the long run, short 
        of a major increase in immigration rates, a dramatic acceleration in productivity 
        growth well beyond historical experience, a significant increase in the 
        age of eligibility for benefits, or the use of general revenues to fund 
        benefits.2

[SECTION]

Indeed, according to the intermediate projection of the social security 
        trustees, the level of social security contributions under current law 
        begins falling short of legislated benefits by approximately 2017. While 
        the prospect of a shortfall in social security is reasonably certain given 
        the changing composition of the population, the range of possible outcomes 
        in Medicare is far wider. Rapidly advancing medical technologies, essentially 
        inelastic demand for medical services for the elderly, and a subsidized 
        third-party payment system have created virtually unconstrained demand.3

[SECTION]

How the financing pressures that accompany increasing retirement are 
        resolved will have profound, but uncertain, effects on the structure of 
        both private and public pension plans. Private pension assets already 
        account for about 12 percent of household financial assets in the United 
        States, a level that will almost certainly increase over the next decade. 
        The total investment income of these funds, in conjunction with retirees' 
        other forms of income, must be sufficient to finance a satisfactory standard 
        of living.

[SECTION]

The real resources available to fund pension benefits depend on the economy's 
        long-term growth rate, which in its simplest terms is determined by the 
        growth rate of labor employed plus the growth rate of the productivity 
        of that labor. As already noted, by 2030 the growth rate of our working-age 
        population is expected to decline by half.

[SECTION]

The fraction of the working-age population actually employed will doubtless 
        be affected by improvements in health or changes in the economic returns 
        to working. Labor productivity has historically been affected by changes 
        in the amount of capital available to each worker, the pace of technical 
        progress and, perhaps more subtly, changes in the experience of our workforce. 
        These elements are key to assessing the economic effects of aging.

[SECTION]

One natural response to population aging will almost surely be for a 
        more fit elderly population to increase their participation in the labor 
        force. Americans not only are living longer, but they are generally living 
        healthier. Rates of disability for the elderly have been declining, reflecting 
        both improvements in health and changes in technology that accommodate 
        the physical impairments that are associated with aging. In addition, 
        work is becoming less physically strenuous but more demanding intellectually, 
        continuing a century-long trend toward a more conceptual and a less physical 
        economic output. For example, in 1900, only one out of every ten workers 
        was in a professional, technical, or managerial occupation. By 1970, that 
        proportion had doubled, and today those types of jobs account for about 
        one-third of our workforce.

[SECTION]

Despite the improving feasibility of work at older ages, Americans have 
        been retiring at younger and younger ages. Some analysts believe this 
        trend has slowed, although few anticipate a rapid turnaround. But rising 
        pressures on retirement incomes and a growing scarcity of experienced 
        labor could induce greater labor-force participation.

[SECTION]

Immigration, if we choose to expand it, could prove an even more potent 
        antidote for slowing growth in the working-age population. As the influx 
        of foreign workers in response to the tight labor markets of the 1990s 
        showed, immigration does respond to labor shortages.

[SECTION]

An expansion of labor-force participation by immigrants and the healthy 
        elderly offers some offset to an aging population. However, it is heightened 
        growth of output per worker that presents the greatest potential to boost 
        the growth of gross domestic product. A significant rise in the growth 
        of labor productivity will be necessary if the standard of living of retirees 
        is to be maintained and that of workers is to continue advancing.

[SECTION]

One of the more direct ways to raise growth in output per hour is to 
        increase saving and investment, which augment the capital stock available 
        to workers. Another is to increase the incentives for innovation; efficiency 
        gains, broadly defined, currently account for roughly half the growth 
        in labor productivity.

[SECTION]

Though augmenting saving and investment should raise future labor productivity 
        and thereby help provide for an aging population, the incremental benefit 
        of additional investment may itself be affected by aging. Without a growing 
        labor force, the amount of new equipment that can be used productively 
        will be more limited, and the return to capital investment could decline 
        as a consequence.

[SECTION]

What actually happens to the saving rate in the next three decades will 
        depend importantly on the behavior of the baby-boom cohort during their 
        retirement years. Over the post-World War II period, the elderly in the 
        United States, contrary to conventional wisdom, seem to have drawn down 
        their savings only modestly. The reasons are not entirely clear. Often 
        people bequeath a significant proportion of their savings to their children 
        or others rather than spending it during retirement. If the baby-boom 
        generation continues this pattern, then the U.S. household saving rate 
        may not decline significantly, if at all.

[SECTION]

The faster rates of aging in Europe and Japan may also directly affect 
        investment and, hence, the growth of labor productivity here in the United 
        States. If saving rates in these countries decline, global capital flows 
        to the United States that have contributed significantly in recent years 
        to financing domestic investment are likely to decline. As in the United 
        States, much will depend on the extent to which retirees in these countries 
        draw down their savings. For example, the saving rate in Japan, even with 
        the rapidly aging population, has not declined to the extent that some 
        had predicted. However, if households in Japan were to start consuming 
        more and saving less, Japan's trade surplus would likely shrink as consumption 
        of imported goods rose. Some of the elevated level of their imports would 
        be exports from the United States, and our trade balance would improve, 
        all else being equal.

[SECTION]

Jobs requiring unskilled labor are likely to continue moving to developing 
        countries, and this transfer may increase foreign direct investment by 
        U.S. firms. Most other developed countries are unlikely to be able to 
        offer higher rates of return because they are already aging faster than 
        the United States.

[SECTION]

Many developing countries have the potential to offer higher rates of 
        return because of their younger and more rapidly growing populations and 
        currently low stocks of capital, but the realization of this potential 
        is far from guaranteed. Historically, returns to investment in many developing 
        countries have been held down by several inhibiting factors: low levels 
        of education, poor infrastructure, and, perhaps most important of all, 
        capricious legal protections.

[SECTION]

Clearly, if net capital inflows into the United States decline, so must 
        our current account and trade deficits. Any such declines must be offset 
        by higher domestic saving--including government saving--if domestic investment 
        in plant and equipment and in housing are to be maintained.

[SECTION]

Future labor productivity, however, is determined by more than just saving, 
        investment, and capital intensity. One of the remarkable features of the 
        economy over the past seven years or so has been the acceleration in the 
        pace of innovative use of capital by workers, rather than increases in 
        the amount of capital per worker. Indeed, as I pointed out earlier, such 
        innovation accounted for about one-half of the rapid increase in labor 
        productivity that we observed in the late 1990s. Therefore, it is important 
        to address the possibility that aging will affect the rate of innovation, 
        either through a rearrangement of existing capital resources or through 
        technological advance.

[SECTION]

Economists understand very little about how technological progress occurs, 
        and research about the effects of aging populations on technological innovation 
        has been sparse. On the one hand, some commentators have worried that 
        an aging population will lead to a less dynamic economy and a lower rate 
        of technological progress; they cite, for example, the fact that the majority 
        of Nobel prizes in the "hard" sciences were awarded for discoveries made 
        by the winners early in their careers. Such issues may have less import 
        going forward, however, as most of the aging of the workforce has already 
        occurred. On the other hand, a slowed rate of growth or a decline in the 
        working-age population may raise technological growth. Although discovery 
        of new technologies is to some degree a matter of luck, we know that human 
        activities do respond to economic incentives. A relative shortage of workers 
        should increase the incentives for developing labor-saving technologies 
        and may actually spur technological development. Economic historians have 
        argued that one reason that the United States surpassed Great Britain 
        in the early nineteenth century as the leader in technological innovation 
        was the relative scarcity of labor in the United States. Patent records 
        of this period show that innovation did respond to economic incentives 
        and that the scarcity of labor clearly provided incentives to develop 
        new methods of production.

The aging of the population means that the government will inevitably 
        need to make a number of changes to its retirement programs. These changes 
        in themselves can have profound economic effects. For example, aside from 
        suppressing economic growth, large increases in payroll taxes can exacerbate 
        the problem of reductions in labor supply, whereas policies to promote 
        longer working life can ameliorate it. Reductions in benefits--through 
        changes to the age for receiving full retirement benefits or through reforms 
        to slow the growth of Medicare spending or through other means--can affect 
        retirement, the labor force, and saving behavior. In addition, policies 
        that link increases in longevity over time to the eligibility age for 
        social security, and perhaps Medicare, may need to be considered. Such 
        linkages would help protect the financial and, hence, the economic viability 
        of these programs.

[SECTION]

The aging of the population is bound to bring with it many changes to 
        our economy--some foreseeable, many probably not. Though the challenges 
        here seem great, the necessary adjustments will likely be smaller than 
        those required in most other developed countries. But how we adjust will 
        also matter. Early initiatives to address the economic effects of baby-boom 
        retirements could smooth the transition to a new balance between workers 
        and retirees. If we delay, the adjustments could be abrupt and painful.

[SECTION]

Fortunately, the U.S. economy is uniquely well suited to make those adjustments. 
        Our open labor markets can adapt to the differing needs and abilities 
        of our older population. Our capital markets can allow for the creation 
        and rapid adoption of new labor-saving technologies, and our open society 
        has been receptive to immigrants. All these factors put us in a good position 
        to adjust to the inexorabilities of an aging population.
