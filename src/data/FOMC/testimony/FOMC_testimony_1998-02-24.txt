Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan
The Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report
Before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy
of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives
February 24, 1998

[SECTION]

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I
          welcome this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's
          semiannual report on economic conditions and the
          conduct of monetary policy.

The U.S. Economy in 1997

[SECTION]

The U.S. economy delivered another exemplary
          performance in 1997.  Over the four quarters of last year,
          real GDP expanded close to 4 percent, its fastest annual
          increase in ten years.  To produce that higher output,
          about 3 million Americans joined the nation's payrolls, in
          the process contributing to a reduction in the
          unemployment rate to 4-3/4 percent, its lowest sustained
          level since the late 1960s.  And our factories were working
          more intensively too:  Industrial production increased 5-3/4 percent
		  last year, exceeding robust additions to
          capacity.

[SECTION]

Those gains were shared widely.  The hourly wage
          and salary structure rose about 4 percent, fueling
          impressive increases in personal incomes.  Unlike some
          prior episodes when faster wage rate increases mainly
          reflected attempts to make up for more rapidly rising
          prices of goods and services, the fatter paychecks that
          workers brought home represented real increments to
          purchasing power.  Measured consumer price inflation
          came in at 1-3/4 percent over the twelve months of 1997,
          down about 1-1/2 percentage points from the pace of the
          prior year.  While swings in the prices of food and fuel
          contributed to this decline, both narrower price indexes
          excluding those items and broader ones including all goods
          and services produced in the United States also paint a
          portrait of continued progress toward price stability.
          Businesses, for the most part, were able to pay these
          higher real wages while still increasing their earnings.
          Although aggregate data on profits for all of 1997 are not
          yet available, corporate profit margins most likely
          remained in an elevated range not seen consistently since
          the 1960s.  These healthy gains in earnings and the
          expectations of more to come provided important support
          to the equity market, with most major stock price indexes
          gaining more than 20 percent over the year.

[SECTION]

The strong growth of the real income of workers
          and corporations is not unrelated to the economy's
          continued good performance on inflation.  Taken together,
          recent evidence supports the view that such low inflation,
          as closely approaching price stability as we have known in
          the United States in three decades, engenders many
          benefits.  When changes in the general price level are
          small and predictable, households and firms can plan more
          securely for the future.  The perception of reduced risk
          encourages investment.  Low inflation also exerts a
          discipline on costs, fostering efforts to enhance
          productivity.  Productivity is the ultimate source of rising
          standards of living, and we witnessed a notable pickup in
          this measure in the past two years.

[SECTION]

The robust economy has facilitated the efforts of
          the Congress and the Administration to restore balance in
          the unified federal budget.  As I have indicated to the
          Congress on numerous occasions, moving beyond this
          point and putting the budget in significant surplus would
          be the surest and most direct way of increasing national
          saving.  In turn, higher national saving, by promoting
          lower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to
          outfit American firms and their workers with the modern
          equipment they need to compete successfully on world
          markets.  We have seen a partial down payment of the
          benefits of better budget balance already:  It seems
          reasonable to assume that the decline in longer-term
          Treasury yields last year owed, in part, to reduced
          competition--current and prospective--from the federal
          government for scarce private saving.  However, additional
          effort remains to be exerted to address the effects on
          federal entitlement spending of the looming shift within
          the next decade in the nation's retirement demographics.

[SECTION]

As I noted earlier, our nation has been experiencing
          a higher growth rate of productivity--output per hour
          worked--in recent years.  The dramatic improvements in
          computing power and communication and information
          technology appear to have been a major force behind this
          beneficial trend.  Those innovations, together with fierce
          competitive pressures in our high-tech industries to make
          them available to as many homes, offices, stores, and shop
          floors as possible, have produced double-digit annual
          reductions in prices of capital goods embodying new
          technologies.  Indeed, many products considered to be at
          the cutting edge of technology as recently as two to three
          years ago have become so standardized and inexpensive
          that they have achieved near "commodity" status, a
          development that has allowed businesses to accelerate
          their accumulation of more and better capital.

[SECTION]

Critical to this process has been the rapidly
          increasing efficiency of our financial markets--itself a
          product of the new technologies and of significant market
          deregulation over the years.  Capital now flows with
          relatively little friction to projects embodying new ideas.
          Silicon Valley is a tribute both to American ingenuity and
          to the financial system's ever-increasing ability to supply
          venture capital to the entrepreneurs who are such a
          dynamic force in our economy.

[SECTION]

With new high-tech tools, American businesses have
          shaved transportation costs, managed their production and
          use of inventories more efficiently, and broadened market
          opportunities.   The threat of rising costs in tight labor
          markets has imparted a substantial impetus to efforts to
          take advantage of possible efficiencies.  In my Humphrey-Hawkins
		  testimony last July, I discussed the likelihood
          that the sharp acceleration in capital investment in
          advanced technologies beginning in 1993 reflected
          synergies of new ideas, embodied in increasingly
          inexpensive new equipment, that have elevated expected
          returns and have broadened investment opportunities.

[SECTION]

More recent evidence remains consistent with the
          view that this capital spending has contributed to a
          noticeable pickup in productivity--and probably by more
          than can be explained by usual business cycle forces.  For
          one, the combination of continued low inflation and
          stable to rising domestic profit margins implies quite
          subdued growth in total consolidated unit business costs.
          With labor costs constituting more than two-thirds of
          those costs and labor compensation per hour accelerating,
          productivity must be growing faster, and that stepup must
          be roughly in line with the increase in compensation
          growth.  For another, our more direct observations on
          output per hour roughly tend to confirm that productivity
          has picked up significantly in recent years, although how
          much the ongoing trend of productivity has risen remains
          an open question.

[SECTION]

The acceleration in productivity, however, has been
          exceeded by the strengthening of demand for goods and
          services.  As a consequence, employers had to expand
          payrolls at a pace well in excess of the growth of the
          working age population that profess a desire for a job,
          including new immigrants.  As I pointed out last year in
          testimony before the Congress, that gap has been
          accommodated by declines in both the officially
          unemployed and those not actively seeking work but
          desirous of working.  The number of people in those two
          categories decreased at a rate of about one million per year
          on average over the last four years.  By December 1997,
          the sum had declined to a seasonally adjusted 10-1/2
          million, or 6 percent of the working age population, the
          lowest ratio since detailed information on this series first
          became available in 1970.  Anecdotal information from
          surveys of our twelve Reserve Banks attests to our ever
          tightening labor markets.

[SECTION]

Rapidly rising demand for labor has had enormous
          beneficial effects on our work force.  Previously low- or
          unskilled workers have been drawn into the job market
          and have obtained training and experience that will help
          them even if they later change jobs.  Large numbers of
          underemployed have been moved up the career ladder to
          match their underlying skills, and many welfare recipients
          have been added to payrolls as well, to the benefit of their
          long-term job prospects.

[SECTION]

The recent acceleration of wages likely has owed in
          part to the ever-tightening labor market and in part to
          rising productivity growth, which, through competition,
          induces firms to grant higher wages.  It is difficult at this
          time, however, to disentangle the relative contributions of
          these factors.  What is clear is that, unless demand growth
          softens or productivity growth accelerates even more, we
          will gradually run out of new workers who can be
          profitably employed.  It is not possible to tell how many
          more of the 6 percent of the working-age population who
          want to work but do not have jobs can be added to
          payrolls.  A significant number are so-called frictionally
          unemployed, as they have left one job but not yet chosen
          to accept another.  Still others have chosen to work in
          only a limited geographic area where their skills may not
          be needed.

[SECTION]

Should demand for new workers continue to exceed
          new supply, we would expect wage gains increasingly to
          exceed productivity growth, squeezing profit margins and
          eventually leading to a pickup in inflation.  Were a
          substantial pickup in inflation to occur, it could, by
          stunting economic growth, reverse much of the remarkable
          labor market progress of recent years.  I will be discussing
          our assessment of these and other possibilities and their
          bearing on the outlook for 1998 shortly.

[SECTION]

Monetary Policy in 1997

[SECTION]

History teaches us that monetary policy has been
          its most effective when it has been preemptive.  The
          lagging relationship between the Federal Reserve's policy
          instrument and spending, and, even further removed,
          inflation, implies that if policy actions are delayed until
          prices begin to pick up, they will be too late to fend off at
          least some persistent price acceleration and attendant
          economic instabilities.  Preemptive policymaking is keyed
          to judging how widespread are emerging inflationary
          forces, and when, and to what degree, those forces will be
          reflected in actual inflation.  For most of last year, the
          evident strains on resources were sufficiently severe to
          steer the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
          toward being more inclined to tighten than to ease
          monetary policy.  Indeed, in March, when it became
          apparent that strains on resources seemed to be
          intensifying, the FOMC imposed modest incremental
          restraint, raising its intended federal funds rate 1/4
          percentage point, to 5-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

We did not increase the federal funds rate again
          during the summer and fall, despite further tightening of
          the labor market.  Even though the labor market heated
          up and labor compensation rose, measured inflation fell,
          owing to the appreciation of the dollar, weakness in
          international commodity prices, and faster productivity
          growth.  Those restraining forces were more evident in
          goods-price inflation, which in the CPI slowed
          substantially to only about 1/2 percent in 1997, than on
          service-price inflation, which moderated much less--to
          around 3 percent.  Providers of services appeared to be
          more pressed by mounting strains in labor markets.
          Hourly wages and salaries in service-producing sectors rose
          4-1/2 percent last year, up considerably from the prior
          year and almost 1-1/2 percentage points faster than in
          goods-producing sectors.  However, a significant portion of
          that differential, but by no means all, traced to
          commissions in the financial and real estate services sector
          related to one-off increases in transactions prices and in
          volumes of activity, rather than to increases in the
          underlying wage structure.

[SECTION]

Although the nominal federal funds rate was
          maintained after March, the apparent drop in inflation
          expectations over the balance of 1997 induced some
          firming in the stance of monetary policy by one important
          measure--the real federal funds rate, or the nominal federal
          funds rate less a proxy for inflation expectations.  Some
          analysts have dubbed the contribution of the reduction in
          inflation expectations to raising the real federal funds rate
          a "passive" tightening, in that it increased the amount of
          monetary policy restraint in place without an explicit vote
          by the FOMC.  While the tightening may have been
          passive in that sense, it was by no means inadvertent.
          Members of the FOMC took some comfort in the upward
          trend of the real federal funds rate over the year and the
          rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar because
          such additional restraint was viewed as appropriate given
          the strength of spending and building strains on labor
          resources.  They also recognized that in virtually all other
          respects financial markets remained quite accommodative
          and, indeed, judging by the rise in equity prices, were
          providing additional impetus to domestic spending.

[SECTION]

The Outlook for 1998

[SECTION]

There can be no doubt that domestic demand
          retained considerable momentum at the outset of this
          year.  Production and employment have been on a strong
          uptrend in recent months.  Confident households,
          enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefitting from
          the reductions in intermediate- and longer-term interest
          rates to date, should continue to increase their spending.
          Firms should find financing available on relatively
          attractive terms to fund profitable opportunities to
          enhance efficiency by investing in new capital equipment.
          By itself, this strength in spending would seem to presage
          intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices.  Yet,
          the outlook for total spending on goods and services
          produced in the United States is less assured of late
          because of storm clouds massing over the Western Pacific
          and heading our way.

[SECTION]

This is not the place to examine in detail what
          triggered the initial problems in Asian financial markets
          and why the subsequent deterioration has been so
          extreme.  I covered that subject recently before several
          committees of the Congress.  Rather, I shall confine my
          discussion this morning to the likely consequences of the
          Asian crisis for demand and inflation in the United States.

[SECTION]

With the crisis curtailing the financing available in
          foreign currencies, many Asian economies have had no
          choice but to cut back their imports sharply.  Disruptions
          to their financial systems and economies more generally
          will further damp demands for our exports of goods and
          services.  American exports should be held down as well by
          the appreciation of the dollar, which will make the prices
          of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just
          as foreign-produced goods will be relatively more attractive
          to buyers here at home.  As a result, we can expect a
          worsening net export position to exert a discernible drag
          on total output in the United States.  For a time, such
          restraint might be reinforced by a reduced willingness of
          U.S. firms to accumulate inventories as they foresee
          weaker demand ahead.

[SECTION]

The forces of Asian restraint could well be providing
          another, more direct offset to inflationary impulses arising
          domestically in the United States.  In the wake of
          weakness in Asian economies and of lagged effects of the
          appreciation of the dollar more generally, the dollar prices
          of our non-oil imports are likely to decline further in the
          months ahead.  These lower import prices are apparently
          already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their
          own prices for fear of losing market share, further
          contributing to the restraint on overall prices.  Lesser
          demands for raw materials on the part of Asian economies
          as their activity slows should help to keep world
          commodity prices denominated in dollars in check.
          Import and commodity prices, however, will restrain U.S.
          inflation only as long as they continue to fall, or to rise at
          a slower rate than the pace of overall domestic product
          prices.

[SECTION]

The key question going forward is whether the
          restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be
          sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might
          otherwise result from the strength of domestic spending
          and tightening labor markets.  The depth of the
          adjustment abroad will depend on the extent of weakness
          in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed
          with which structural inefficiencies in the financial and
          nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected.  If,
          as we suspect, the restraint coming from Asia is sufficient
          to bring the demand for American labor back into line
          with the growth of the working-age population desirous of
          working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but
          any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very
          gradual, and readily reversible.  However, we cannot rule
          out two other, more worrisome possibilities.  On the one
          hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be
          offset significantly by Asian or other developments, the
          U.S. economy would be on a track along which spending
          could press too strongly against available resources to be
          consistent with contained inflation.  On the other, we also
          need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from Asia
          might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable
          by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of
          net exports and the prices of imports.

[SECTION]

When confronted at the beginning of this month
          with these, for the moment, finely balanced, though
          powerful forces, the members of the Federal Open Market
          Committee decided that monetary policy should most
          appropriately be kept on hold.  With the continuation of
          a remarkable seven-year expansion at stake and so little
          precedent to go by, the range of our intelligence gathering
          in the weeks ahead must be wide and especially inclusive
          of international developments.
          The Forecasts of the Governors of the Federal Reserve
          Board and the Presidents of the Federal Reserve
          Banks.

[SECTION]

In these circumstances, the forecasts of the
          governors of the Federal Reserve Board and presidents of
          the Federal Reserve Banks for the performance of the U.S
          economy over this year are more tentative than usual.
          Based on information available through the first week of
          February, monetary policymakers were generally of the
          view that moderate economic growth is likely in store.
          The growth rate of real GDP is most commonly seen as
          between 2 and 2-3/4 percent over the four quarters of
          1998.  Given the strong performance of real GDP, these
          projections envisage the unemployment rate remaining in
          the low range of the past half year.  Inflation, as measured
          by the four-quarter percent change in the consumer price
          index, is expected to be 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent in 1998--near
		   the low rate recorded in 1997.  This outlook
          embodies the expectation that the effects of continuing
          tightness in labor markets will be largely offset by
          technical adjustments shaving a couple tenths from the
          published CPI, healthy productivity growth, flat or
          declining import prices, and little pressure in commodity
          markets.  But the policymakers' forecasts also reflect their
          determination to hold the line on inflation.

The Ranges for the Debt and Monetary Aggregates

[SECTION]

The FOMC affirmed the provisional ranges for the
          monetary aggregates in 1998 that it had selected last July,
          which, once again, encompass the growth rates associated
          with conditions of approximate price stability, provided
          that these aggregates act in accord with their pre-1990s
          historical relationships with nominal income and interest
          rates.  These ranges are identical to those that had
          prevailed for 1997--1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6
          percent for M3.  The FOMC also reaffirmed its range of 3
          to 7 percent for the debt of the domestic nonfinancial
          sectors for this year.  I should caution, though, that the
          expectations of the governors and Reserve Bank presidents
          for the expansion of nominal GDP in 1998 suggest that
          growth of M2 in the upper half of its benchmark range is
          a distinct possibility this year.  Given the continuing
          strength of bank credit, M3 might even be above its range
          as depositories use liabilities in this aggregate to fund loan
          growth and securities acquisitions.  Nonfinancial debt
          should come in around the middle portion of its range.
          In the first part of the 1990s, money growth
          diverged from historical relationships with income and
          interest rates, in part as savers diversified into bond and
          stock mutual funds, which had become more readily
          available and whose returns were considerably more
          attractive than those on deposits.  This anomalous
          behavior of velocity severely set back most analysts'
          confidence in the usefulness of M2 as an indicator of
          economic developments.  In recent years, there have been
          tentative signs that the historical relationship linking the
          velocity of M2--measured as the ratio of nominal GDP to
          the money stock--to the cost of holding M2 assets was
          reasserting itself.  However, a persistent residual upward
          drift in velocity over the past few years and its apparent
          cessation very recently underscores our ongoing
          uncertainty about the stability of this relationship.  The
          FOMC will continue to observe the evolution of the
          monetary and credit aggregates carefully, integrating
          information about these variables with a wide variety of
          other information in determining its policy stance.

Uncertainty about the Outlook

[SECTION]

With the current situation reflecting a balance of
          strong countervailing forces, events in the months ahead
          are not likely to unfold smoothly.  In that regard, I would
          like to flag a few areas of concern about the economy
          beyond those mentioned already regarding Asian
          developments.

[SECTION]

Without doubt, lenders have provided important
          support to spending in the past few years by their
          willingness to transact at historically small margins and in
          large volumes.  Equity investors have contributed as well
          by apparently pricing in the expectation of substantial
          earnings gains and requiring modest compensation for the
          risk that those expectations could be mistaken.
          Approaching the eighth year of the economic expansion,
          this is understandable in an economic environment that,
          contrary to historical experience, has become increasingly
          benign.  Businesses have been meeting obligations readily
          and generating high profits, putting them in outstanding
          financial health.

[SECTION]

But we must be concerned about becoming too
          complacent about evaluating repayment risks.  All too
          often at this stage of the business cycle, the loans that
          banks extend later make up a disproportionate share of
          total nonperforming loans.  In addition, quite possibly,
          twelve or eighteen months hence, some of the securities
          purchased on the market could be looked upon with some
          regret by investors.  As one of the nation's bank
          supervisors, the Federal Reserve will make every effort to
          encourage banks to apply sound underwriting standards in
          their lending.  Prudent lenders should consider a wide
          range of economic situations in evaluating credit; to do
          otherwise would risk contributing to potentially disruptive
          financial problems down the road.

[SECTION]

A second area of concern involves our nation's
          continuing role in the new high-tech international
          financial system.  By joining with our major trading
          partners and international financial institutions in helping
          to stabilize the economies of Asia and promoting needed
          structural changes, we are also encouraging the continued
          expansion of world trade and global economic and
          financial stability on which the ongoing increase of our
          own standards of living depends.  If we were to cede our
          role as a world leader, or backslide into protectionist
          policies, we would threaten the source of much of our own
          sustained economic growth.

[SECTION]

A third risk is complacency about inflation
          prospects.  The combination and interaction of significant
          increases in productivity-improving technologies, sharp
          declines in budget deficits, and disciplined monetary
          policy has damped product price changes, bringing them
          to near stability.  While part of this result owes to good
          policy, part is the product of the fortuitous emergence of
          new technologies and of some favorable price
          developments in imported goods.  However, as history
          counsels, it is unwise to count on any string of good
          fortune to continue indefinitely.  At the same time,
          though, it is also instructive to remember the words of an
          old sage that "luck is the residue of design."  He meant
          that to some degree we can deliberately put ourselves in
          position to experience good fortune and be better prepared
          when misfortune strikes.  For example, the 1970s were
          marked by two major oil-price shocks and a significant
          depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar.  But
          those misfortunes were, in part, the result of allowing
          imbalances to build over the decade as policymakers lost
          hold of the anchor provided by price stability.  Some of
          what we now see helping rein in inflation pressures is more
          likely to occur in an environment of stable prices and price
          expectations that thwarts producers from indiscriminately
          passing on higher costs, puts a premium on productivity
          enhancement, and rewards more effectively investment in
          physical and human capital.

[SECTION]

Simply put, while the pursuit of price stability does
          not rule out misfortune, it lowers its probability.  If firms
          are convinced that the general price level will remain
          stable, they will reserve increases in their sales prices of
          goods and services as a last resort, for fear that such
          increases could mean loss of market share.  Similarly, if
          households are convinced of price stability, they will not
          see variations in relative prices as reasons to change their
          long-run inflation expectations.  Thus, continuing to make
          progress toward this legislated objective will make future
          supply shocks less likely and our nation's economy less
          vulnerable to those that occur.
