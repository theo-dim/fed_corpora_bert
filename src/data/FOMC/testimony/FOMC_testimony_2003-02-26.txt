Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee, it is 
        a pleasure to appear once again before this Committee to present the views 
        of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on deposit insurance. 
        Rather than refer to any specific bill, I will express the broad views 
        of the Federal Reserve Board on the issues associated with modifications 
        of deposit insurance. Those views have not changed since our testimony 
        before this Committee on April 23, 2002.

[SECTION]

At the outset, I note that the 2001 report of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Corporation (FDIC) on deposit insurance highlighted the significant issues 
        and developed an integrated framework for addressing them. Although as 
        before the Board opposes any increase in coverage, we continue to support 
        the framework constructed by the FDIC report for addressing other reform 
        issues.

[SECTION]

Benefits and Costs of Deposit Insurance
        Deposit insurance was adopted in this country as part of the legislative 
        effort to limit the impact of the Great Depression on the public. Against 
        the backdrop of a record number of bank failures, the Congress designed 
        deposit insurance mainly to protect the modest savings of unsophisticated 
        depositors with limited financial assets. With references being made to 
        "the rent money," the initial 1934 limit on deposit insurance was $2,500; 
        the Congress promptly doubled the limit to $5,000 but then kept it at 
        that level for the next sixteen years. I should note that the $5,000 of 
        insurance provided in 1934, an amount consistent with the original intent 
        of the Congress, is equal to slightly less than $60,000 today, based on 
        the personal consumption expenditures deflator in the gross domestic product 
        accounts.

[SECTION]

Despite its initial quite limited intent, the Congress has raised the 
        maximum amount of coverage five times since 1950, to its current level 
        of $100,000. The last increase, in 1980, more than doubled the limit and 
        was clearly designed to let depositories, particularly thrift institutions, 
        offer an insured deposit free of the then-prevailing interest rate ceilings 
        on such instruments, which applied only to deposits below $100,000. 
        Insured deposits of exactly $100,000 thus became fully insured 
        instruments in 1980 but were not subject to an interest rate ceiling. 
        The efforts of thrift institutions to use $100,000 CDs to stem their liquidity 
        outflows resulting from public withdrawals of smaller, below-market-rate 
        insured deposits led first to an earnings squeeze and an associated loss 
        of capital and then to a high-risk investment strategy that led to failure 
        after failure. Depositors acquiring the new larger-denomination insured 
        deposits were aware of the plight of the thrift institutions but unconcerned 
        about the risk because the principal amounts of their $100,000 deposits 
        were fully insured by the federal government. In this way, the 1980 increase 
        in deposit insurance to $100,000 exacerbated the fundamental problem facing 
        thrift institutions--a concentration on long-term assets in an environment 
        of high and rising interest rates. Indeed, it significantly increased 
        the taxpayer cost of the bailout of the bankrupt thrift institution deposit 
        insurance fund.

[SECTION]

Despite this problematic episode, deposit insurance has clearly played 
        a key--at times even critical--role in achieving the stability in banking 
        and financial markets that has characterized the nearly seventy years 
        since its adoption. Deposit insurance, combined with other components 
        of our banking safety net (the Federal Reserve's discount window and its 
        payment system guarantees), has meant that periods of financial stress 
        no longer entail widespread depositor runs on banks and thrift institutions. 
        Quite the opposite: Asset holders now seek out deposits--both insured 
        and uninsured--as safe havens when they have strong doubts about other 
        financial assets.

[SECTION]

Looking beyond the contribution of deposit insurance to overall financial 
        stability, we should not minimize the importance of the security it has 
        brought to millions of households and small businesses with relatively 
        modest financial assets. Deposit insurance has given them a safe and secure 
        place to hold their transaction and other balances.

[SECTION]

The benefits of deposit insurance, as significant as they are, have not 
        come without a cost. The very process that has ended deposit runs has 
        made insured depositors largely indifferent to the risks taken by their 
        depository institutions, just as it did with depositors in the 1980s with 
        regard to insolvent, risky thrift institutions. The result has been a 
        weakening of the market discipline that insured depositors would otherwise 
        have imposed on institutions. Relieved of that discipline, depositories 
        naturally feel less cautious about taking on more risk than they would 
        otherwise assume. No other type of private financial institution is able 
        to attract funds from the public without regard to the risks it takes 
        with its creditors' resources. This incentive to take excessive risks 
        at the expense of the insurer, and potentially the taxpayer, is the so-called 
        moral hazard problem of deposit insurance.

[SECTION]

Thus, two offsetting implications of deposit insurance must be kept in 
        mind. On the one hand, it is clear that deposit insurance has contributed 
        to the prevention of bank runs that could have destabilized the financial 
        structure in the short run. On the other, even the current levels of deposit 
        insurance may have already increased risk-taking at insured depository 
        institutions to such an extent that future systemic risks have arguably 
        risen.

[SECTION]

Indeed, the reduced market discipline and increased moral hazard at depositories 
        have intensified the need for government supervision to protect the interests 
        of taxpayers and, in essence, substitute for the reduced market discipline. 
        Deposit insurance and other components of the safety net also enable banks 
        and thrift institutions to attract more resources, at lower costs, than 
        would otherwise be the case. In short, insured institutions receive a 
        subsidy in the form of a government guarantee that allows them both to 
        attract deposits at lower interest rates than would be necessary without 
        deposit insurance and to take more risk without the fear of losing their 
        deposit funding. Put another way, deposit insurance misallocates resources 
        by breaking the link between risks and rewards for a select set of market 
        competitors.

[SECTION]

In sum, from the very beginning, deposit insurance has involved a tradeoff. 
        Deposit insurance contributes to overall short-term financial stability 
        and the protection of small depositors. But at the same time, because 
        it also subsidizes deposit growth and induces greater risk-taking, deposit 
        insurance misallocates resources and creates larger long-term financial 
        imbalances that increase the need for government supervision to protect 
        the taxpayers' interests. Deposit insurance reforms must balance these 
        tradeoffs. Moreover, any reforms should be aimed primarily at protecting 
        the interest of the economy overall and not just the profits or market 
        shares of particular businesses.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve Board believes that deposit insurance reforms should 
        be designed to preserve the benefits of heightened financial stability 
        and the protection of small depositors without a further increase in moral 
        hazard or reduction in market discipline. In addition, we urge that the 
        implementing details be kept as straightforward as possible to minimize 
        the risk of unintended consequences that comes with complexity.

[SECTION]

Issues for Reform 
        The FDIC has made five broad recommendations.

[SECTION]

1. Merge BIF and SAIF 
        The Board supports the FDIC's proposal to merge the Bank Insurance Fund 
        (BIF) with the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Because the 
        charters and operations of banks and thrift institutions have become so 
        similar, it makes no sense to continue the separate funds. Separate funds 
        reflect the past but neither the present nor the future. Merging the funds 
        would diversify their risks, reduce administrative expense, and widen 
        the fund base of an increasingly concentrated banking system. Most important, 
        because banks and thrift institutions receive the same level of federally 
        guaranteed insurance coverage, the premiums faced by each set of institutions 
        should be identical as well. Under current arrangements, the premiums 
        faced by equally risky institutions could differ significantly if one 
        of the funds falls below the designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent 
        of insured deposits and the other fund does not. Should that occur, depository 
        institutions would be induced to switch charters to obtain insurance from 
        the fund with the lower premium, a result that could distort our depository 
        structure. The federal government should not sell a single service, like 
        deposit insurance, at different prices.

[SECTION]

2. Reduce Statutory Restrictions on Premiums 
        Current law requires the FDIC to impose higher premiums on riskier banks 
        and thrift institutions but prevents it from imposing any premium on well-capitalized 
        and highly rated institutions when the corresponding fund's reserves exceed 
        1.25 percent of insured deposits. The Board endorses the FDIC recommendations 
        that would eliminate the statutory restrictions on risk-based pricing 
        and allow a premium to be imposed on every insured depository institution, 
        no matter how well capitalized and well rated it may be or how high the 
        fund's reserves.

[SECTION]

The current statutory requirement that free deposit insurance be provided 
        to well-capitalized and highly rated institutions when the ratio of FDIC 
        reserves to insured deposits exceeds a predetermined ratio maximizes the 
        subsidy provided to these institutions and is inconsistent with efforts 
        to avoid inducing moral hazard. Put differently, the current rule requires 
        the government to give away its valuable guarantee to many institutions 
        when fund reserves meet some ceiling level. This free guarantee is of 
        value to institutions even when they themselves are in sound financial 
        condition and when macroeconomic times are good. At the end of the third 
        quarter of last year, 91 percent of banks and thrift institutions were 
        paying no premium. That group included many institutions that have never 
        paid a premium for their, in some cases substantial, coverage, and it 
        also included fast-growing entities whose past premiums were extraordinarily 
        small relative to their current coverage. We believe that these anomalies 
        were never intended by the framers of the Deposit Insurance Fund Act of 
        1996 and should be addressed by the Congress.

[SECTION]

The Congress did intend that the FDIC impose risk-based premiums, but 
        the 1996 act limits the ability of the FDIC to impose risk-based premiums 
        on well-capitalized and highly rated banks and thrift institutions. And 
        these two variables--capital strength and overall examiner rating--do 
        not capture all the risk that institutions could create for the insurer. 
        The Board believes that the FDIC should be free to establish risk categories 
        on the basis of any economic variables shown to be related to an institution's 
        risk of failure, and to impose premiums commensurate with that risk. Although 
        a robust risk-based premium system would be technically difficult to design, 
        a closer link between insurance premiums and the risk of individual institutions 
        would reduce moral hazard and the distortions in resource allocation that 
        accompany deposit insurance.

[SECTION]

We note, however, that although significant benefits from a risk-based 
        premium system are likely to require a substantial range of premiums, 
        the FDIC concluded in its report that premiums for the riskiest banks 
        would probably need to be capped in order to avoid inducing failure at 
        these weaker institutions. We believe that capping premiums may end up 
        costing the insurance fund more in the long run should these weak institutions 
        fail anyway, with the delay increasing the ultimate cost of resolution. 
        The Board has concluded, therefore, that if a cap on premiums is required, 
        it should be set quite high so that risk-based premiums can be as effective 
        as possible in deterring excessive risk-taking. In that way, we could 
        begin to simulate the deposit insurance pricing that the market would 
        apply and reduce the associated subsidy in deposit insurance.

[SECTION]

Nonetheless, we should not delude ourselves into believing that even 
        a wider range in the risk-based premium structure would eliminate the 
        need for a government back-up to the deposit insurance fund, that is, 
        eliminate the government subsidy in deposit insurance. To eliminate the 
        subsidy in deposit insurance--to make deposit insurance a real insurance 
        system--the FDIC average insurance premium would have to be set high enough 
        to cover fully the very small probabilities of very large losses, such 
        as those incurred during the Great Depression, and thus the perceived 
        costs of systemic risk. In contrast to life or automobile casualty insurance, 
        each individual insured loss in banking is not independent of other losses. 
        Banking is subject to systemic risk and is thus subject to a far larger 
        extreme loss in the tail of the probability distributions from which real 
        insurance premiums would have to be calculated. Indeed, pricing deposit 
        insurance risks to fully fund potential losses--pricing to eliminate subsidies--could 
        well require premiums that would discourage most depository institutions 
        from offering broad coverage to their customers. Since the Congress has 
        determined that there should be broad coverage, the subsidy in deposit 
        insurance cannot be fully eliminated, although we can and should 
        eliminate as much of the subsidy as we can.

[SECTION]

I note that the difficulties of raising risk-based premiums explain why 
        there is no real private-insurer substitute for deposit insurance from 
        the government. No private insurer would ever be able to match the actual 
        FDIC premium and cover its risks. A private insurer confronted with the 
        possibility, remote as it may be, of losses that could bankrupt it would 
        need to set especially high premiums to protect itself, premiums that 
        few, if any, depository institutions would find attractive. And if premiums 
        were fully priced by the government or the private sector, the depository 
        institutions would likely lower their offering rates, thereby reducing 
        the amount of insured deposits demanded, and consequently the amount outstanding 
        would decline.

[SECTION]

3. Relaxing the Reserve Ratio Regime to Allow Gradual Adjustments 
        in Premiums 
        Current law establishes a designated reserve ratio for BIF and SAIF of 
        1.25 percent. If that ratio is exceeded, the statute requires that premiums 
        be discontinued for well-capitalized and highly rated institutions. If 
        the ratio declines below 1.25 percent, the FDIC must develop a set of 
        premiums to restore the reserve ratio to 1.25 percent; if the fund ratio 
        is not likely to be restored to its statutorily designated level within 
        twelve months, the law requires that a premium of at least 23 basis points 
        be imposed on all insured entities.

[SECTION]

These requirements are clearly procyclical: They lower or eliminate fees 
        in good times, when bank credit is readily available and deposit insurance 
        fund reserves should be built up, and abruptly increase fees sharply in 
        times of weakness, when bank credit availability is under pressure and 
        deposit fund resources are drawn down to cover the resolution of failed 
        institutions. The FDIC recommends that surcharges or rebates be used to 
        bring the fund back to the target reserve ratio gradually. The FDIC also 
        recommends the possibility of a target range for the designated reserve 
        ratio, over which the premiums may remain constant, rather than a fixed 
        target reserve ratio and abruptly changing premiums.

[SECTION]

We support such increased flexibility and smoothing of changes in premiums. 
        Indeed, we recommend that the FDIC's suggested target reserve range be 
        widened to reduce the need to change premiums abruptly. Any floor or ceiling, 
        regardless of its level, could require that premiums be increased at exactly 
        the time when banks and thrifts could be under stress and, similarly, 
        that premiums be reduced at the time that depositories are in the best 
        position to fund an increase in reserves. Building a larger fund in good 
        times and permitting it to decline when necessary are prerequisites to 
        less variability in the premium.

[SECTION]

In addition to supporting a widening of the range for the designated 
        reserve ratio, the Board recommends that the FDIC be given the latitude 
        to temporarily relax floor or ceiling ratios on the basis of current and 
        anticipated banking conditions and expected needs for resources to resolve 
        failing institutions. In short, to enhance macroeconomic stability, we 
        prefer a reduction in the specificity of the rules under which the FDIC 
        operates and, within the broad guidelines set out by the Congress, an 
        increase in the flexibility with which the board of the FDIC can operate.

[SECTION]

4. Modify the Rebates System 
        Since its early days, the FDIC has rebated "excess" premiums whenever 
        it considered its reserves to be adequate. This procedure was replaced 
        in the 1996 law by the requirement that no premium be imposed on well-capitalized 
        and highly rated institutions when the relevant fund reached its designated 
        reserve ratio. The FDIC's 2001 proposals would re-impose a minimum premium 
        on all banks and thrift institutions and a more risk-sensitive premium 
        structure. These provisions would be coupled with rebates for the stronger 
        entities when the fund approaches the upper end of a target range and 
        surcharges when the fund trends below the lower end of a target range.

[SECTION]

The FDIC also recommends that the rebates not be uniform for the stronger 
        entities. Rather, the FDIC argues that rebates should be smaller for those 
        banks that have paid premiums for only short periods or that have in the 
        past paid premiums that are not commensurate with their present size and 
        consequent FDIC exposure. The devil, of course, is in the details. But 
        varying the rebates in this way makes considerable sense, and the Board 
        endorses it. More than 900 banks--some now quite large--have never paid 
        a premium, and without this modification they would continue to pay virtually 
        nothing, net of rebates, as long as their strong capital and high supervisory 
        ratings were maintained. Such an approach is both competitively inequitable 
        and contributes to moral hazard. It should be addressed.

[SECTION]

5. Indexing Ceilings on the Coverage of Insured Deposits. 
        
        The FDIC recommends that the current $100,000 ceiling on insured deposits 
        be indexed to inflation. The Board does not support this recommendation 
        and believes that the current ceiling should be maintained.

[SECTION]

In the Board's judgment, increasing the coverage, even by indexing, is 
        unlikely to add measurably to the stability of the banking system. Macroeconomic 
        policy and other elements of the safety net--combined with the current, 
        still-significant level of deposit insurance--continue to be important 
        bulwarks against bank runs. Thus, the problem that increased coverage 
        is designed to solve must be related either to the individual depositor, 
        the party originally intended to be protected, or to the individual bank 
        or thrift institution. Clearly, both groups would prefer higher coverage 
        if it cost them nothing. But the Congress needs to be clear about the 
        nature of a specific problem for which increased coverage would be the 
        solution.

[SECTION]

Depositors. Our most recent surveys of consumer finances suggest 
        that most depositors have balances well below the current insurance limit 
        of $100,000, and those that do have larger balances have apparently been 
        adept at achieving the level of deposit insurance coverage they desire 
        by opening multiple insured accounts. Such spreading of assets is perfectly 
        consistent with the counsel always given to investors to diversify their 
        assets--whether stocks, bonds, or mutual funds--across different issuers. 
        The cost of diversifying for insured deposits is surely no greater than 
        doing so for other assets. A bank would clearly prefer that the depositor 
        maintain all of his or her funds at that bank and would prefer to reduce 
        the need for depositor diversification by being able to offer higher deposit 
        insurance coverage. Nonetheless, depositors appear to have no great difficulty--should 
        they want insured deposits--in finding multiple sources of fully insured 
        accounts.

[SECTION]

In addition, one of the most remarkable characteristics of household 
        holdings of financial assets has been the increase in the diversity of 
        portfolio choices since World War II. And, since the early 1970s the share 
        of household financial assets in bank and thrift deposits has generally 
        declined steadily as households have taken advantage of innovative, attractive 
        financial instruments with market rates of return. The trend seems to 
        bear no relation to past increases in insurance ceilings. Indeed, the 
        most dramatic substitution out of deposits has been the shift from both 
        insured and uninsured deposits into equities and into mutual funds that 
        hold equities, bonds, and money market assets. It is difficult to believe 
        that a change in ceilings during the 1990s would have made any measurable 
        difference in that shift. Rather, the data indicate that the weakness 
        in stock prices in recent years has been marked by increased flows into 
        bank and thrift deposits even without changed insurance coverage levels.

[SECTION]

Depository Institutions. Does the problem to be solved by increased 
        deposit insurance coverage concern the individual depository institution? 
        If so, the problem would seem disproportionately related to small banks 
        because insured deposits are a much larger proportion of total funding 
        at small banks than at large banks. But smaller banks appear to be doing 
        well. Since the mid-1990s, adjusted for the effects of mergers, assets 
        of banks smaller than the largest 1,000 have grown at an average annual 
        rate of 13.8 percent, more than twice the pace of the largest 1,000 banks. 
        Uninsured deposits, again adjusted for the effects of mergers, have grown 
        at average annual rates of 21 percent at the small banks versus 10 percent 
        at the large banks. Clearly, small banks have a demonstrated skill and 
        ability to compete for uninsured deposits. To be sure, uninsured deposits 
        are more expensive than insured deposits, and bank costs would decline 
        and profits rise if their currently uninsured liabilities received a government 
        guarantee. But that is the issue of whether subsidizing bank profits through 
        additional deposit insurance serves a national purpose. I might add that 
        throughout the 1990s and into the present century, return on equity at 
        small banks has been well maintained. Indeed, the attractiveness of banking 
        is evidenced by the fact that more than 1,350 banks were chartered during 
        the past decade, including more than 600 from 1999 through 2002.

[SECTION]

Some small banks argue that they need enhanced deposit insurance coverage 
        to compete with large banks because depositors prefer to put their uninsured 
        funds in an institution considered too big to fail. As I have noted, however, 
        small banks have more than held their own in the market for uninsured 
        deposits. In addition, the Board rejects the notion that any bank is too 
        big to fail. In the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), the Congress 
        made it clear that the systemic-risk exception to the FDIC's least-cost 
        resolution of a failing bank should be invoked only under the most unusual 
        circumstances. Moreover, the resolution rules under the systemic-risk 
        exception do not require that uninsured depositors and other creditors, 
        much less stockholders, be made whole. The market has clearly evidenced 
        the view, consistent with FDICIA, that large institutions are not too 
        big for uninsured creditors to take at least some loss should the institution 
        fail. For example, no U.S. banking organization, no matter how large, 
        is AAA-rated. In addition, research indicates that creditors impose higher 
        risk premiums on the uninsured debt of relatively risky large banking 
        organizations and that this market discipline has increased since the 
        enactment of FDICIA.

[SECTION]

To be sure, the real purchasing power of deposit insurance ceilings has 
        declined. But there is no evidence of any significant detrimental effect 
        on depositors or depository institutions, with the possible exception 
        of a small reduction in those profits that accrue from deposit guarantee 
        subsidies that lower the cost of insured deposits. The current deposit 
        insurance ceiling appears more than adequate to achieve the positive benefits 
        of deposit insurance that I mentioned earlier, even if its real value 
        were to erode further.

Another argument is often raised by smaller banks regarding the need 
        for increased deposit insurance coverage. Some smaller institutions say 
        that they are unable to match the competition from large securities firms 
        and bank holding companies with multiple bank or thrift institution affiliates 
        because those entities offer multiple insured accounts through one organization. 
        I note that since the Committee's last hearings on this issue, the force 
        of small banks' concerns has been reduced by recent market developments 
        in which small banks and thrift institutions can use a clearinghouse network 
        for brokered deposits that allows them to offer full FDIC insurance for 
        large accounts. The Board agrees that such practices by both large and 
        small depositories are a misuse of deposit insurance. Moreover, raising 
        the coverage limit for each account is not a remedy for small banks because 
        it would also increase the aggregate amount of insurance coverage that 
        multidepository organizations would be able to offer. The disparity would 
        remain.

Conclusion 
        Several aspects of the deposit insurance system need reform. The Board 
        supports, with some modifications, all of the recommendations the FDIC 
        made in the spring of 2001 except indexing the current $100,000 ceiling 
        to inflation. The thrust of our recommendations would call for a wider 
        permissible range for the size of the fund relative to insured deposits, 
        reduced variation of the insurance premium as the relative size of the 
        fund changes with banking and economic conditions, a positive and more 
        risk-based premium net of rebates for all depository institutions, and 
        the merging of BIF and SAIF.

There may come a time when the Board finds that households and businesses 
        with modest resources are having difficulty in placing their funds in 
        safe vehicles or that the level of deposit coverage appears to be endangering 
        financial stability. Should either of those events occur, the Board would 
        call its concerns to the attention of the Congress and support adjustments 
        to the ceiling by indexing or other methods. But today, in our judgment, 
        neither financial stability, nor depositors, nor depositories are being 
        disadvantaged by the current ceiling. Raising the ceiling now would extend 
        the safety net, increase the government subsidy to depository institutions, 
        expand moral hazard, and reduce the incentive for market discipline without 
        providing any clear public benefit. With no clear public benefit to increasing 
        deposit insurance, the Board sees no reason to increase the scope of the 
        safety net. Indeed, the Board believes that as our financial system has 
        become ever more complex and exceptionally responsive to the vagaries 
        of economic change, structural distortions induced by government guarantees 
        have risen. We have no way of ascertaining at exactly what point subsidies 
        provoke systemic risk. Nonetheless, prudence suggests that we be exceptionally 
        deliberate when expanding government financial guarantees.
