Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased to be here today to 
              offer my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy.

[SECTION]

The economy appears to have emerged around the middle of last year 
              from an extended stretch of subpar growth and entered a period of 
              more vigorous expansion. After having risen at an annual rate of 
              2-1/2 percent in the first half of last year, real GDP increased 
              at an annual pace of more than 6 percent in the second half. Aided 
              by tax cuts, low interest rates, and rising wealth, household spending 
              continued to post sizable gains last year. In addition, an upturn 
              in business investment, which followed several years of lackluster 
              performance, and a sharp rise in exports contributed importantly 
              to the acceleration in real GDP over 2003.

Although real GDP is not likely to continue advancing at the same 
              pace as in the second half of 2003, recent data indicate that growth 
              of activity has remained robust thus far this year. Household spending 
              has continued to move up, and residential home sales and construction 
              remain at elevated levels. In addition, the improvement in business 
              activity has become more widespread. In the industrial sector, nearly 
              two-thirds of the industries that make up the index of industrial 
              production have experienced an increase in output over the past 
              three months. More broadly, indicators of business investment point 
              to increases in spending for many types of capital equipment. And 
              importantly, the latest employment figures suggest that businesses 
              are becoming more willing to add to their workforces, with the result 
              that the labor market now appears to be gradually improving after 
              a protracted period of weakness.

[SECTION]

Looking forward, the prospects for sustaining solid economic growth 
              in the period ahead are good. Monetary policy remains quite accommodative, 
              with short-term real interest rates still close to zero. In addition, 
              fiscal policy will likely continue to provide considerable impetus 
              to domestic spending through the end of this year.

[SECTION]

Importantly, the caution among business executives that had previously 
              led them to limit their capital expenditures appears to be giving 
              way to a growing confidence in the durability of the expansion. 
              That confidence has, no doubt, been bolstered by favorable borrowing 
              conditions, ongoing improvements in efficiency, and rising profitability, 
              which have put many firms on a more solid financial footing.

[SECTION]

Nevertheless, some of the strains that accompanied the difficult 
              business environment of the past several years apparently still 
              linger. Although businesses are replacing obsolescent equipment 
              at an accelerated pace, many managers continue to exhibit an unusual 
              reluctance to anticipate and prepare for future orders by adding 
              to their capital stock. Despite a dramatic increase in cash flow, 
              business fixed and inventory investment, taken together, have risen 
              only moderately. Indeed, internal corporate funds exceeded investment 
              over the course of last year for the first time since 1975.

[SECTION]

Similar cautious behavior has also been evident in the hiring decisions 
              of U.S. firms, during the past several years. Rather than seeking 
              profit opportunities in expanding markets, business managers hunkered 
              down and focused on repairing severely depleted profitability predominately 
              by cutting costs and restricting their hiring. Firms succeeded in 
              that endeavor largely by taking advantage of the untapped potential 
              for increased efficiencies that had built up during the rapid capital 
              accumulation of the latter part of the 1990s. That process has not 
              yet played out completely. Many firms seem to be continuing to find 
              new ways to exploit the technological opportunities embodied in 
              the substantial investments in high-tech equipment that they had 
              made over the past decade.

When aggregate demand accelerated in the second half of 2003, the 
              pace of job cuts slowed. But because of the newfound improvements 
              in the efficiency of their operations, firms were able to meet increasing 
              demand without adding many new workers.

[SECTION]

As the opportunities to enhance efficiency from the capital investments 
              of the late 1990s inevitably become scarcer, productivity growth 
              will doubtless slow from its recent phenomenal pace. And, if demand 
              continues to firm, companies will ultimately find that they have 
              no choice but to increase their workforces if they are to address 
              growing backlogs of orders. In such an environment, the pace of 
              hiring should pick up on a more sustained basis, bringing with it 
              larger persistent increases in net employment than those prevailing 
              until recently.

[SECTION]

Still, the anxiety that many in our workforce feel will not subside 
              quickly. In March of this year, about 85,000 jobless individuals 
              per week exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits--more than 
              double the 35,000 per week in September 2000. Moreover, the average 
              duration of unemployment increased from twelve weeks in September 
              2000 to twenty weeks in March of this year. These developments have 
              led to a notable rise in insecurity among workers.

[SECTION]

Most of the recent increases in productivity have been reflected 
              in a sharp rise in the pretax profits of nonfinancial corporations 
              from a very low 7 percent share of that sector's gross value added 
              in the third quarter of 2001 to a high 12 percent share in the fourth 
              quarter of last year. The increase in real hourly compensation was 
              quite modest over that period. The consequence was a marked fall 
              in the ratio of employee compensation to gross nonfinancial corporate 
              income to a very low level by the standards of the past three decades.

[SECTION]

If history is any guide, competitive pressures, at some point, 
              will shift in favor of real hourly compensation at the expense of 
              corporate profits. That shift, coupled with further gains in employment, 
              should cause labor's share of income to begin to rise toward historical 
              norms.

[SECTION]

Such a process need not add to inflation pressures. Although labor 
              costs, which compose nearly two-thirds of consolidated costs, no 
              longer seem to be falling at the pace that prevailed in the second 
              half of last year, those costs have yet to post a decisive upturn. 
              And even if they do, the current high level of profit margins suggests 
              that firms may come under competitive pressure to absorb some acceleration 
              of labor costs. Should such an acceleration of costs persist, however, 
              higher price inflation would inevitably follow.

[SECTION]

The pace of economic expansion here and abroad is evidently contributing 
              to some price pressures at earlier stages of the production process 
              and in energy markets, and the decline in the dollar's exchange 
              rate has fostered a modest firming of core import prices. More broadly, 
              however, although the recent data suggest that the worrisome trend 
              of disinflation presumably has come to an end, still-significant 
              productivity growth and a sizable margin of underutilized resources, 
              to date, have checked any sustained acceleration of the general 
              price level and should continue to do so for a time. Moreover, the 
              initial effect of a slowing of productivity growth is more likely 
              to be an easing of profit margins than an acceleration of prices.

[SECTION]

As I have noted previously, the federal funds rate must rise at 
              some point to prevent pressures on price inflation from eventually 
              emerging. As yet, the protracted period of monetary accommodation 
              has not fostered an environment in which broad-based inflation pressures 
              appear to be building. But the Federal Reserve recognizes that sustained 
              prosperity requires the maintenance of price stability and will 
              act, as necessary, to ensure that outcome.
