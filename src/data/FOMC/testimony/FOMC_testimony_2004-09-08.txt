Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am 
        pleased to be here today to offer my views on the state of the U.S. economy 
        and current fiscal issues. I speak for myself and not necessarily for 
        the Federal Reserve.

[SECTION]

As you know, economic activity hit a soft patch in late spring after 
        having grown briskly in the second half of 2003 and the first part of 
        2004. Consumer spending slowed materially, and employment gains moderated 
        notably after the marked step-up in early spring. That softness in activity 
        no doubt is related, in large measure, to this year's steep increase in 
        energy prices.

[SECTION]

The most recent data suggest that, on the whole, the expansion has regained 
        some traction. Consumer spending and housing starts bounced back in July 
        after weak performances in June, although early readings on retail sales 
        in August have been mixed. In addition, business investment remains on 
        a solid upward trend. In the manufacturing sector, output has continued 
        to move up in recent months, though part of that rise likely reflected 
        an increase in inventory investment. In the labor market, though job gains 
        were smaller than those of last spring, nonfarm payroll employment growth 
        picked back up in August.

[SECTION]

Despite the rise in oil prices through mid-August, inflation and inflation 
        expectations have eased in recent months. To be sure, unit labor costs 
        rose in the second quarter as productivity growth slowed from its extraordinary 
        pace of the past two years and employee compensation per hour remained 
        on an upward trend. But, as best we can judge, the growth in profit margins 
        of non-energy, nonfinancial, corporations, which, at least from an accounting 
        perspective, had contributed significantly to price pressures earlier, 
        has recently slowed. Moreover, increases in non-oil import prices have 
        lessened--a development that, coupled with the slowing of profit-margin 
        growth, has helped to lower core consumer price inflation in recent months.

[SECTION]

Movements in energy prices have been a major influence on overall inflation 
        this year. In the second quarter, gasoline prices rose rapidly as a marked 
        pickup in gasoline demand strained refinery capacity and resulted in sharply 
        higher profit margins. In May and June, refinery and marketing margins 
        rose to levels that were 25 cents to 30 cents per gallon over typical 
        spreads going into the summer driving season.

[SECTION]

As a consequence of the steep run-up in prices, demand for gasoline 
        eased, and an accompanying increase in inventories helped to reverse the 
        bulge that had occurred in refinery and marketing margins. That reduction 
        in margins resulted in a decline in the price of regular gasoline of about 
        20 cents per gallon despite the concurrent sharp rise in the price of 
        crude oil. With margins having returned to more-typical levels, prices 
        of both gasoline and home heating oil are likely to reflect changes in 
        crude oil prices more directly.

[SECTION]

Evaluating the impact of rising oil prices on economic activity in the 
        United States has long been a subject of dispute among economists. Most 
        macroeconomic models treat an increase in oil prices as a tax on U.S. 
        residents that saps the purchasing power of households and raises costs 
        for businesses. But economists disagree about the size of the effects, 
        in part because of differences in the key assumptions employed in the 
        statistical models that underlie the analyses. Moreover, the models are 
        typically based on average historical experience, which is dominated by 
        periods of only moderate fluctuations in oil prices and thus may not adequately 
        capture the adverse effects on the economy of oil price spikes. In addition 
        to the difficulties of measuring the impact of oil prices on economic 
        growth, the oil price outlook itself is uncertain.

[SECTION]

Growing concerns about the long-term security of oil production in the 
        Middle East, along with heightened worries about the reliability of supply 
        from other oil-producing regions, led to a pronounced increase in the 
        demand to hold inventory at a time when the level of world commercial 
        oil stocks was rising only modestly. Some of that increased demand came 
        from investors and speculators who took on larger net long positions in 
        crude oil futures, especially in distantly dated contracts. Crude oil 
        prices accordingly rose sharply, which, in turn, brought forth increased 
        production from OPEC and induced some investors to take profits on long 
        inventory positions. The resulting reduction in the speculative demand 
        for inventories has, at least temporarily, reduced pressures in these 
        markets, and crude prices have come off from their highs of mid-August.

[SECTION]

Nevertheless, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain. Higher prices 
        have damped the consumption of oil--for example, U.S. gasoline consumption, 
        seasonally adjusted, fell about 200,000 barrels a day between April and 
        July. But the growing concerns about long-term supply, along with large 
        prospective increases in demand from the rapidly growing economies of 
        China and India, both of which are expanding in ways that are relatively 
        energy intensive, have propelled prices of distant futures to levels well 
        above their ranges of recent years.

[SECTION]

Meanwhile, despite the paucity of new discoveries of major oil fields, 
        improving technology has significantly increased the ultimate recovery 
        of oil from already existing fields. During the past decade, despite more 
        than 250 billion barrels of oil extracted worldwide, net proved reserves 
        rose well in excess of 100 billion barrels. That is, gross additions to 
        reserves have significantly exceeded the extraction of oil the reserves 
        replaced. Indeed, in fields where, two decades ago, roughly one-third 
        of the oil in place ultimately could be extracted, almost half appears 
        to be recoverable today. Gains in proved reserves have been concentrated 
        among OPEC members, though proved reserves in the United States, essentially 
        offshore, rose 3-1/2 percent during the past five years. The uptrend in 
        proved reserves is likely to continue at least for awhile. Oil service 
        firms continue to report significant involvement in reservoir extension 
        and enhancement.

[SECTION]

Nevertheless, future balances between supply and demand will remain 
        precarious, and incentives for oil consumers in developed economies to 
        decrease the oil intensity of their economies will doubtless continue. 
        Presumably similar developments will emerge in the large oil-consuming 
        developing economies.

[SECTION]

The remainder of my remarks will address the federal budget, for which 
        the incoming data suggest that the unified deficit has recently leveled 
        out. With the economy continuing to improve, the deficit is more likely 
        to decline than to increase in the year ahead.

[SECTION]

Nonetheless, the prospects for the federal budget over the longer term 
        remain troubling. As yet, concerns about the budget do not appear to have 
        left a noticeable imprint on the financial markets. In recent years, even 
        as fiscal discipline has eroded, implied one-year forward Treasury rates 
        at long horizons, which history suggests are sensitive to changes in the 
        fiscal outlook, have held fairly steady. Various measures of long-term 
        real interest rates have also remained at moderate levels over this period.

[SECTION]

These developments, however, do not warrant complacency about the fiscal 
        outlook. With the baby boomers starting to retire in a few years and health 
        spending continuing to soar, our budget position will almost surely deteriorate 
        substantially in coming years if current policies remain in place.

[SECTION]

The enormous improvement of the federal budget balance in the second 
        half of the 1990s and early in the current decade was due importantly 
        to the rapid growth in labor productivity during that period, which led, 
        both directly and indirectly, to a vast but, in retrospect, temporary 
        increase in revenues. The Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990, and the 
        later modifications and extensions of the act, almost surely contributed 
        to the better budget outcomes as well, before the brief emergence of surpluses 
        eroded the will to adhere to its deficit-containment rules. The key provisions 
        of the BEA expired in 2002, and no replacement has been adopted.

[SECTION]

Reinstatement of a structure like the BEA would signal a renewed commitment 
        to fiscal restraint and would help restore discipline to the annual budgeting 
        process. But it would be only a part of any meaningful endeavor to establish 
        a framework for fiscal policy choices. The BEA was designed to constrain 
        legislative actions on new initiatives. It contained no provisions for 
        dealing with unanticipated budgetary outcomes over time. It was also not 
        designed to be the centerpiece for longer-run budget policy; importantly, 
        the BEA did not set a clear objective toward which fiscal policy should 
        aim.

[SECTION]

Budget outcomes over the next decade will deviate, as they always have 
        from projections--perhaps, significantly. Accordingly, it would be quite 
        helpful to have mechanisms in place that assist the Congress in making 
        mid-course corrections as needed. Four or five decades ago, such mechanisms 
        were unnecessary, in part because much of the budget was determined on 
        an annual basis. Indeed, in the 1960s, discretionary spending, which is 
        subject to the annual appropriations process and thus comes under regular 
        review by the Congress, accounted for about two-thirds of total outlays. 
        That share dropped markedly in the 1970s and 1980s as spending on retirement, 
        medical, and other entitlement programs rose sharply. In the early 1990s, 
        it fell below 40 percent, where it has remained over the past decade.

[SECTION]

The rise in the share of expenditures that is not subject to annual 
        review complicates the task of making fiscal policy by effectively necessitating 
        an extension of the budget planning horizon. In the 1960s and early 1970s, 
        the President's budgets provided information mainly for the upcoming fiscal 
        year. The 1974 legislation that established a new budget process and created 
        the Congressional Budget Office required that CBO provide five-year budget 
        projections. By the mid-1990s, CBO's projection horizon had been pushed 
        out to ten years.

[SECTION]

Given the changing composition of outlays, these longer planning horizons 
        and the associated budget projections were essential steps toward allowing 
        the Congress to balance budget priorities sensibly. Among other things, 
        this change has made the budget process more reliant on forecasting. To 
        be sure, forecasting has become more sophisticated as statistical techniques 
        and economic models have evolved. But because of the increasing complexity 
        of our markets, the inaccuracy of forecasts--especially those that go 
        beyond the near term--is a large problem.

[SECTION]

A well-designed set of measures for mid-course corrections would likely 
        include regular assessments of existing programs to verify that they continue 
        to meet their stated purposes and cost projections. Although the vast 
        majority of existing programs would doubtless be extended routinely, some 
        that face appreciable opposition and offer limited societal benefit might 
        not clear hurdles set by the Congress unamended, if at all. More generally, 
        mechanisms, such as triggers, to bring the budget back into line if it 
        goes off track should be considered, particularly measures that force 
        a mid-course correction when estimated future costs for a program or tax 
        provision exceed a specified threshold.

[SECTION]

I do not mean to suggest that our budget problems will be solved simply 
        by adopting a set of budget rules that restrain new legislation--even 
        if those rules are augmented by effective mechanisms for making mid-course 
        corrections. The fundamental challenge that we face is to come to grips 
        with the adverse budgetary implications of an aging population and current 
        health entitlements and with the limits on our ability to project the 
        likely path of medical outlays. The rapid increase in revenues during 
        the 1990s significantly muted the necessity of making choices between 
        high-priority tax and spending initiatives. In the context of an unprecedented 
        increase in retirees, the need to make stark choices among budget priorities 
        will again become pressing. Federally funding access to advances in medical 
        technology, for example, likely will have to be weighed against other 
        spending programs as well as tax initiatives that foster increases in 
        economic growth and the revenue base.

[SECTION]

Because the baby boomers have not yet started to retire in force and 
        accordingly the ratio of retirees to workers remains relatively low, we 
        are in a demographic lull. But short of an outsized acceleration of structural 
        productivity or a major expansion of immigration, this state of relative 
        tranquility will soon end.

[SECTION]

In 2008--just four years from now--the leading edge of the baby-boom 
        generation will reach 62, the earliest age at which Social Security retirement 
        benefits may be claimed and the age at which about half of prospective 
        beneficiaries have retired in recent years. In 2011, these individuals 
        will reach 65 and will thus be eligible for Medicare.

[SECTION]

The pressures on the federal budget from these demographic changes will 
        come on top of those stemming from the relentless upward trend in expenditures 
        on medical care. Indeed, outlays for Medicare and Medicaid have grown 
        much faster than has nominal GDP in recent years, and no significant slowing 
        seems to be in the offing.

[SECTION]

In 2003, outlays for Social Security and Medicare amounted to about 
        7 percent of GDP; according to the programs' trustees, by 2030 that ratio 
        will nearly double. Moreover, such projections are subject to considerable 
        uncertainty, especially those for Medicare. Unlike Social Security, where 
        benefits are tied in a mechanical fashion to retirees' wage histories 
        and we have some useful tools for forecasting future benefits, the possible 
        variance in medical spending rises dramatically as we move into the next 
        decade and beyond. As with Social Security, forecasting the number of 
        Medicare beneficiaries is reasonably straightforward. But we know very 
        little about how rapidly medical technology will continue to advance and 
        how those innovations will translate into future spending. Technological 
        innovations can greatly improve the quality of medical care and can, in 
        some instances, reduce the costs of existing treatments. But because technology 
        expands the set of treatment possibilities, it also has the potential 
        to add to overall spending--in some cases, by a great deal. Other sources 
        of uncertainty--for example, about how longer life expectancies among 
        the elderly will affect medical spending--may also turn out to be important. 
        As a result, the range of future possible outlays per recipient is extremely 
        wide.

[SECTION]

Developing ways to deal with these uncertainties will be a major part 
        of an effective budget strategy for the longer run. Critical to that evaluation 
        is the possibility that, as a nation, we may have already made promises 
        to coming generations of retirees that we will be unable to fulfill. If, 
        on further study, that possibility turns out to be the case, it is imperative 
        that we make clear what real resources will be available so that our citizens 
        can properly plan their retirements. This problem raises a more-general 
        principle of public policy prudence. If, as history strongly suggests, 
        entitlement benefits and tax credits, once bestowed, are difficult to 
        repeal, consideration should be given to developing a framework that recognizes 
        that potential asymmetry.

[SECTION]

Re-establishing an effective procedural framework for budgetary decisionmaking 
        should be a high priority. But it is only a start. As we prepare for the 
        retirement of the baby-boom generation and confront the implications of 
        soaring expenditures for medical care, a major effort by policymakers 
        to set priorities for tax and spending programs and to start making tradeoffs 
        is long overdue.

[SECTION]

The significant improvement in the budget in the 1990s reflected persistent 
        efforts on the part of this committee and others. If similar efforts are 
        made now, they should assist in preparing our economy for the fiscal challenges 
        that we will face in the years ahead.
