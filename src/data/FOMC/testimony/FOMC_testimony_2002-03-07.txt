Since July, when I last reported to you on the conduct of monetary policy, 
        the U.S. economy has gone through a period of considerable strain, with 
        output contracting for a time and unemployment rising. We in the Federal 
        Reserve System acted vigorously to adjust monetary policy in an endeavor 
        both to limit the extent of the downturn and to hasten its completion. 
        Despite the disruptions engendered by the terrorist attacks of September 
        11, the typical dynamics of the business cycle have re-emerged and are 
        prompting a firming in economic activity. The recent evidence increasingly 
        suggests that an economic expansion is already well under way, although 
        an array of influences unique to this business cycle seems likely to moderate 
        its speed.

[SECTION]

At the time of our last report, the economy was weakening. Many firms 
        were responding to the realization that significant overcapacity had developed. 
        The demand for capital goods had dropped sharply, and inventories were 
        uncomfortably high in many industries. In response, businesses slashed 
        production, and the resulting declines in incomes amplified the cyclical 
        downturn. Real gross domestic product did not grow in the second quarter 
        and contracted in the third.

[SECTION]

A coincident deceleration in activity among the world economies was evident 
        over the past year, owing, at least in part, to the retrenchment in the 
        high-technology sector and the global reach of the capital markets in 
        which the firms in that sector are valued and funded. However, before 
        the terrorist attacks, it was far from obvious that this concurrent weakness 
        was becoming self-reinforcing. Indeed, immediately prior to September 
        11, some sectors exhibited tentative signs of stabilization, contributing 
        to a hope that the worst of the previous cumulative weakness in world 
        economic activity was nearing an end.

[SECTION]

That hope was decisively dashed by the tragic events of early September. 
        Adding to the intense forces weighing on asset prices and economic activity 
        before September 11 were new sources of uncertainty that began to press 
        down on global demand for goods and services. Economies almost everywhere 
        weakened further, a cause for increasing uneasiness. The simultaneous 
        further slowing in activity raised concerns that a self-reinforcing cycle 
        of contraction, fed by perceptions of greater economic risk, could develop. 
        Such an event, though rare, would not be unprecedented in business-cycle 
        history.

[SECTION]

If ever a situation existed in which the fabric of business and consumer 
        confidence, both here and abroad, was vulnerable to being torn, the shock 
        of September 11 was surely it. In addition to the horrific loss of life, 
        enormous uncertainties accompanied the unfolding events and their implications 
        for the economy. Indeed, for a period of weeks, U.S. economic activity 
        did drop dramatically in response to that shock.

[SECTION]

In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, the Federal Reserve engaged 
        in aggressive action to counter the effects of the shock on payment systems 
        and financial markets. We provided a huge volume of reserves through open 
        market operations, the discount window, and other means to facilitate 
        the functioning of the financial system. We worked closely with many market 
        participants, industry groups, and other government officials on a broad 
        range of financial infrastructure problems that needed to be resolved 
        quickly and in the common interest.

[SECTION]

Still, market functioning was impaired for a time. The substantial damage 
        to trading, settlement, and communications facilities forced many market 
        participants to their backup sites. Owing in part to careful and thorough 
        contingency planning, many firms, markets, and exchanges were able to 
        resume business within a few hours or days of the attacks. Nonetheless, 
        the episode did reveal threats to, and vulnerabilities of, the operations 
        of financial institutions that had not been previously considered and 
        illustrated the significant interdependence of the modern financial infrastructure. 
        Institutions will need to continue to work diligently toward ensuring 
        that their backup capabilities are adequate. We at the Federal Reserve 
        have been reexamining intensively our own contingency capabilities to 
        ensure that our central banking functions can be performed in the most 
        pressing of emergency circumstances.

[SECTION]

In the weeks following the attacks, along with the drops in activity 
        and confidence, equity prices fell markedly, and lenders became more cautious, 
        boosting risk premiums, especially on credits already considered to be 
        weak. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates 
        considerably further. Longer-term yields, including mortgage rates, fell 
        to extraordinarily low levels. The monetary stimulus that we provided 
        was visible not only in interest rates but also in a rapid growth of liquidity 
        over the final months of the year, as gauged by the broad monetary aggregates. 
        As the fourth quarter progressed, business and consumer confidence recovered, 
        no doubt buoyed by successes in the war on terrorism. The improved sentiment 
        seemed to buffer the decline in economic activity.

[SECTION]

Indeed, in the past several months, increasing signs have emerged that 
        some of the forces that have been restraining the economy over the past 
        year are starting to diminish and that activity is beginning to firm. 
        The appearance of these signs, in circumstances in which the level of 
        the real federal funds rate was at a very low level, led the Federal Open 
        Market Committee to keep policy unchanged at its meeting in late January, 
        although it retained its assessment that the risks were tilted toward 
        economic weakness.

[SECTION]

*  *  *

[SECTION]

One key consideration in the assessment that the economy is moving through 
        a turning point is the behavior of inventories. Stocks in many industries 
        have been drawn down to levels at which firms will soon need to taper 
        off their rate of liquidation, if they have not already done so. Any slowing 
        in the rate of inventory liquidation will induce a rise in industrial 
        production if demand for those products is stable or is falling only moderately. 
        That rise in production will, other things being equal, increase household 
        income and spending. The runoff of inventories, even apart from the large 
        reduction in motor vehicle stocks, remained sizable in the fourth quarter. 
        Hence, with production running well below sales, the lift to income and 
        spending from the inevitable cessation of inventory liquidation could 
        be significant.

[SECTION]

But that impetus to the growth of activity will be short-lived unless 
        sustained increases in final demand kick in before the positive effects 
        of the swing from inventory liquidation dissipate. We have seen encouraging 
        signs in recent days that underlying trends in final demand are strengthening, 
        although the dimensions of the pickup remain uncertain.

[SECTION]

Most recoveries in the post-World War II period received a boost from 
        a rebound in demand for consumer durables and housing from recession-depressed 
        levels in addition to an abatement of inventory liquidation. Through much 
        of last year's slowdown, however, spending by the household sector held 
        up well and proved to be a major stabilizing force. As a consequence, 
        although household spending should continue to trend up, the potential 
        for significant acceleration in activity in this sector is likely to be 
        more limited than in past cycles.

[SECTION]

In fact, there are a number of cross currents in the outlook for household 
        spending. In recent months, low mortgage interest rates and favorable 
        weather have provided considerable support to homebuilding. Moreover, 
        attractive mortgage rates have bolstered the sales of existing homes and 
        the extraction of capital gains embedded in home equity that those sales 
        engender. Low rates have also encouraged households to take on larger 
        mortgages when refinancing their homes. Drawing on home equity in this 
        manner is a significant source of funding for consumption and home modernization. 
        The pace of such extractions likely dropped along with the decline in 
        refinancing activity that followed the backup in mortgage rates that began 
        in early November. But mortgage rates remain at low levels and should 
        continue to underpin activity in this sector.

[SECTION]

Consumer spending received a considerable lift from the sales of new 
        motor vehicles, which were remarkably strong in October and November owing 
        to major financing incentives. Sales have receded somewhat, but they have 
        remained surprisingly resilient. Other consumer spending appears to have 
        advanced at a solid pace in recent months.

[SECTION]

The substantial declines in the prices of natural gas, fuel oil, and 
        gasoline have clearly provided some support to real disposable income 
        and spending. To have a more persistent effect on the ongoing growth of 
        total personal consumption expenditures, energy prices would need to decline 
        further. Futures prices do not suggest that such an outcome is in the 
        offing, though the forecast record of these markets is less than impressive.

[SECTION]

Changes in household financial positions in recent years are probably 
        damping consumer spending, at least to a degree. Overall household wealth 
        relative to income has dropped from a peak multiple of about 6.3 at the 
        end of 1999 to around 5.3 currently. Moreover, the aggregate household 
        debt service burden, defined as the ratio of households' required debt 
        payments to their disposable personal income, rose considerably in recent 
        years, returning last year to its previous cyclical peak of the mid-1980s.

[SECTION]

However, neither wealth nor the burden of debt is distributed evenly 
        across households. Hence, the spending effects of changes in these influences 
        also will not be evenly distributed. For example, increased debt burdens 
        appear disproportionately attributable to higher-income households. Calculations 
        by staff at the Federal Reserve suggest that the ratio of household liabilities 
        to annual income for the top fifth of all households ranked by income, 
        who accounted for 44 percent of total after-tax household income last 
        year, rose from about 1.10 at the end of 1998 to 1.20 at the end of the 
        third quarter of 2001. The increase for the lower four-fifths was only 
        about half as large. Although high-income households should not experience 
        much strain in meeting their obligations, others might. Indeed, repayment 
        difficulties have already increased, particularly in the subprime markets 
        for consumer loans and mortgages. Delinquency rates may well worsen as 
        a delayed result of the strains on household finances over the past two 
        years. Large erosions, however, do not seem likely, and the overall levels 
        of debt and repayment delinquencies do not, as of now, appear to pose 
        a major impediment to a moderate expansion of consumption spending going 
        forward.

[SECTION]

Although the macroeconomic effects of debt burdens may be limited, we 
        have already seen significant spending restraint among the top fifth of 
        income earners, presumably owing to the drop in equity prices. The effect 
        of the stock market on other households' spending has been less evident. 
        Moderate-income households have a much larger proportion of their assets 
        in homes, and the continuing rise in the value of houses has provided 
        greater support for their net worth. Reflecting these differences in portfolio 
        composition, the net worth of the top fifth of income earners has dropped 
        far more than it did for the bottom 80 percent.

[SECTION]

As a consequence, excluding capital gains and losses from the calculation, 
        as is the convention in our national income accounts, personal saving 
        for the upper fifth, which had been negative during 1999 and 2000, turned 
        positive in 2001. By contrast, the average saving rate for the lower four-fifths 
        of households, by income, was generally positive during the second half 
        of the 1990s and has fluctuated in a narrow range in the past two years. 
        Accordingly, most of the change in consumption expenditures that resulted 
        from the bull stock market, and its demise, reflected shifts in spending 
        by upper-income households. The restraining effects from the net decline 
        in wealth during the past two years presumably have not, as yet, fully 
        played out and could exert some further damping effect on the overall 
        growth of household spending relative to that of income.

[SECTION]

Perhaps most central to the outlook for consumer spending will be developments 
        in the labor market. The pace of layoffs quickened last fall, especially 
        after September 11, and the unemployment rate rose sharply. However, layoffs 
        diminished noticeably in January, and the reported unemployment rate declined—though 
        adjusting for seasonal influences was difficult last month. Moreover, 
        initial claims for unemployment insurance have decreased markedly, on 
        balance, providing further evidence of an improvement in labor market 
        conditions. Even if the economy is on the road to recovery, the unemployment 
        rate, in typical cyclical fashion, may resume its increase for a time, 
        and a soft labor market could put something of a damper on consumer spending.

[SECTION]

However, the extent of such restraint will depend on how much of any 
        rise in unemployment is the result of weakened demand for goods and services 
        and how much reflects strengthened productivity. In the latter case, average 
        real incomes of workers could rise, at least partially offsetting losses 
        of purchasing power that stem from diminished levels of employment. Indeed, 
        preliminary data suggest that productivity has held up very well of late, 
        and history suggests that any depressing effect of rapid productivity 
        growth on employment is only temporary.

The dynamics of inventory investment and the balance of factors influencing 
        consumer demand will have important consequences for the economic outlook 
        in coming months. But the broad contours of the present cycle have been, 
        and will continue to be, driven by the evolution of corporate profits 
        and capital investment.

[SECTION]

The retrenchment in capital spending over the past year and a half was 
        central to the sharp slowing we experienced in overall activity. The steep 
        rise in high-tech spending that occurred in the early post-Y2K months 
        was clearly not sustainable. The demand for many of the newer technologies 
        was growing rapidly, but capacity was expanding even faster, and that 
        imbalance exerted significant downward pressure on prices and the profits 
        of producers of high-tech goods and services. New orders for equipment 
        and software hesitated in the middle of 2000 and then fell abruptly as 
        firms re-evaluated their capital investment programs. Uncertainty about 
        economic prospects boosted risk premiums significantly, and this rise, 
        in turn, propelled required, or hurdle, rates of return to markedly elevated 
        levels. In most cases, businesses required that new investments pay off 
        much more rapidly than they had previously. For much of last year, the 
        resulting decline in investment outlays was fierce and unrelenting. Although 
        the weakness was most pronounced in the technology area, reductions in 
        capital outlays were broad-based.

[SECTION]

These cutbacks in capital spending interacted with, and were reinforced 
        by, falling profits and equity prices. Indeed, a striking feature of the 
        current cyclical episode relative to many earlier ones has been the virtual 
        absence of pricing power across much of American business, as increasing 
        globalization and deregulation have enhanced competition. In this low-inflation 
        environment, firms have perceived very little ability to pass cost increases 
        on to customers. To be sure, growth in hourly labor compensation has moderated 
        in response to slowed inflation and deteriorating economic conditions. 
        A significant falloff in stock-option realizations and in other forms 
        of compensation related to company performance has likely been a factor. 
        But over most of the past year, even those smaller hourly compensation 
        increases outstripped gains in output per hour, on balance, precipitating 
        a marked decline in profit margins.

[SECTION]

Business managers, with little opportunity to raise prices, have moved 
        aggressively to stabilize cash flows by trimming workforces. These efforts 
        have limited any rise in unit costs, attenuated the pressure on profit 
        margins, and ultimately helped to preserve the vast majority of private-sector 
        jobs. To the extent that businesses are successful in stabilizing and 
        eventually boosting profits and cash flow, capital spending should begin 
        to recover more noticeably.

[SECTION]

Part of the reduction in pricing power observed in this cycle should 
        be reversed as firming demand enables firms to take back large price discounts. 
        Though such an adjustment would tend to elevate price levels, underlying 
        inflationary cost pressures should remain contained. To be sure, output 
        per hour is not likely to accelerate this year as much as in a typical 
        recovery because businesses have not delayed, as they have in past recessions, 
        shedding workers at the first indications of weakened demand. But slack 
        in labor markets and further increases in productivity should hold labor 
        costs in check and result in rising profit margins even with inflation 
        remaining low.

[SECTION]

Improved profit margins and more assured prospects for rising final demand 
        would likely be accompanied by a decline in risk premiums from their current 
        elevated levels toward a more normal range. With real rates of return 
        on high-tech equipment still attractive, that should provide an additional 
        spur to new investment. Reports from businesses around the country suggest 
        that the exploitation of available networking and other information technologies 
        was only partially completed when the cyclical retrenchment of the past 
        year began. Many business managers are still of the view, according to 
        a recent survey of purchasing managers, that less than half of currently 
        available new, and presumably profitable, supply-chain technologies have 
        been put into use.

[SECTION]

Recent evidence suggests that a recovery in at least some forms of high-tech 
        investment could already be under way. Production of semiconductors, which 
        in the past has been a leading indicator of computer production, turned 
        up last fall. Expenditures on computers rose at a double-digit annual 
        rate in real terms last quarter. But investment expenditures in the communications 
        sector, where the amount of overcapacity was substantial, as yet show 
        few signs of turning up, and business investment in some other sectors, 
        such as aircraft, hit by the drop in air travel, will presumably remain 
        weak this year.

[SECTION]

On balance, the recovery in overall spending on business fixed investment 
        is likely to be only gradual; in particular, its growth will doubtless 
        be less frenetic than in 1999 and early 2000—a period during which 
        outlays were boosted by the dislocations of Y2K and the extraordinarily 
        low cost of equity capital available to many firms. Nonetheless, if the 
        recent more-favorable economic developments gather momentum, uncertainties 
        will diminish, risk premiums will fall, and the pace of capital investment 
        embodying new technologies will increase.

[SECTION]

Even a subdued recovery would constitute a truly remarkable performance 
        for the American economy in the face of so severe a decline in equity 
        asset values and an unprecedented blow from terrorists to the foundations 
        of our market systems. For, if the tentative indications that the contraction 
        phase of this business cycle has drawn to a close are ultimately confirmed, 
        we will have experienced a significantly milder downturn than the long 
        history of business cycles would have led us to expect. Crucially, the 
        imbalances that triggered the downturn and that could have prolonged this 
        difficult period did not fester. The obvious questions are what has changed 
        in our economy in recent decades to provide such resilience and whether 
        such changes will persist into the future.

[SECTION]

Doubtless, the substantial improvement in the access of business decisionmakers 
        to real-time information has played a key role. Thirty years ago, the 
        timeliness of available information varied across companies and industries, 
        often resulting in differences in the speed and magnitude of their responses 
        to changing business conditions. In contrast to the situation that prevails 
        today, businesses did not have real-time data systems that enabled decisionmakers 
        in different enterprises to work from essentially the same set of information. 
        In those earlier years, imbalances were inadvertently allowed to build 
        to such an extent that their inevitable correction engendered significant 
        economic stress. That process of correction and the accompanying economic 
        and financial disruptions too often led to deep and prolonged recessions. 
        Today, businesses have large quantities of data available virtually in 
        real time. As a consequence, they address and resolve economic imbalances 
        far more rapidly than in the past.

[SECTION]

The apparent increased flexibility of the American economy arguably also 
        reflects the extent of deregulation over the past quarter century. Certainly, 
        if the energy sector were still in the tight regulatory fetters of the 
        1970s, our flexibility today would be markedly less. That the collapse 
        of Enron barely registered in the relatively recently developed markets 
        for natural gas and electric power was encouraging. Although the terrorist 
        attacks hit air travel especially hard over the past few months, deregulation 
        of that industry has demonstrably increased the quantity and flexibility, 
        if not the profitability, of air travel over the past twenty years. Trucking 
        and rail deregulation has added flexibility to the movement of goods across 
        our nation.

[SECTION]

Both deregulation and innovation in the financial sector have been especially 
        important in enhancing overall economic resilience. New financial products—including 
        derivatives, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, 
        and collateralized mortgage obligations, among others—have enabled 
        risk to be dispersed more effectively to those willing to, and presumably 
        capable of, bearing it. Shocks to the overall economic system are accordingly 
        less likely to create cascading credit failure. Lenders have the opportunity 
        to be considerably more diversified, and borrowers are far less dependent 
        on specific institutions for funds. Financial derivatives, particularly, 
        have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past fifteen years, evidently 
        fulfilling a need to hedge risks that were not readily deflected in earlier 
        decades. Despite the concerns that these complex instruments have induced 
        (an issue I will address shortly), the record of their performance, especially 
        over the past couple of stressful years, suggests that on balance they 
        have contributed to the development of a far more flexible and efficient 
        financial system—both domestically and internationally—than 
        we had just twenty or thirty years ago.

[SECTION]

As a consequence of increased access to real-time information and, more 
        arguably, extensive deregulation in financial and product markets and 
        the unbundling of risk, imbalances are more likely to be readily contained, 
        and cyclical episodes overall should be less severe than would be the 
        case otherwise. If this is indeed the case—and it must be considered 
        speculative until more evidence is gathered—the implied reduction 
        in volatility, other things equal, would lower risk and equity premiums.

[SECTION]

Other things, however, may not be wholly equal. The very technologies 
        that appear to be the main cause of our apparent increased flexibility 
        and resiliency may also be imparting different forms of vulnerability 
        that could intensify or be intensified by a business cycle.

[SECTION]

From one perspective, the ever-increasing proportion of our GDP that 
        represents conceptual as distinct from physical value added may actually 
        have lessened cyclical volatility. In particular, the fact that concepts 
        cannot be held as inventories means a greater share of GDP is not subject 
        to a type of dynamics that amplifies cyclical swings. But an economy in 
        which concepts form an important share of valuation has its own vulnerabilities.

[SECTION]

As the recent events surrounding Enron have highlighted, a firm is inherently 
        fragile if its value added emanates more from conceptual as distinct from 
        physical assets. A physical asset, whether an office building or an automotive 
        assembly plant, has the capability of producing goods even if the reputation 
        of the managers of such facilities falls under a cloud. The rapidity of 
        Enron's decline is an effective illustration of the vulnerability of a 
        firm whose market value largely rests on capitalized reputation. The physical 
        assets of such a firm comprise a small proportion of its asset base. Trust 
        and reputation can vanish overnight. A factory cannot.

The implications of such a loss of confidence for the macroeconomy depend 
        importantly on how freely the conceptual capital of the fading firm can 
        be replaced by a competitor or a new entrant into the industry. Even if 
        entry is relatively free, macroeconomic risks can emerge if problems at 
        one particular firm tend to make investors and counterparties uncertain 
        about other firms that they see as potentially similarly situated. The 
        difficulty of valuing firms that deal primarily with concepts and the 
        growing size and importance of these firms may make our economy more susceptible 
        to this type of contagion.

[SECTION]

Another, more conventional determinant of stability will be the economy's 
        degree of leverage—the extent to which debt rather than equity is 
        financing the level of capital. The proper degree of leverage in a firm, 
        or in an economy as a whole, is an inherently elusive figure that almost 
        certainly changes from time to time. Clearly, firms find some leverage 
        advantageous in enhancing returns on equity, and thus moderate leverage 
        undoubtedly boosts the capital stock and the level of output. A sophisticated 
        financial system, with its substantial array of instruments to unbundle 
        risks, will tend toward a higher degree of leverage at any given level 
        of underlying economic risk. But, the greater the degree of leverage in 
        any economy, the greater its vulnerability to unexpected shortfalls in 
        demand and mistakes.

[SECTION]

Indeed, on a historical cost basis, the ratio of debt to net worth for 
        the nonfinancial corporate business sector did rise, from 71 percent at 
        the end of 1997 to about 81 percent at the end of the third quarter of 
        last year, though it is still well below its level at the beginning of 
        the recession in 1990. The ratio of interest payments to cash flow, one 
        indicator of the consequence of leverage, has crept up in recent years, 
        reflecting growth in debt. However, owing to lower interest rates, it 
        remains far below its levels of the early 1990s.

[SECTION]

Although the fears of business leverage have been mostly confined to 
        specific sectors in recent years, concerns over potential systemic problems 
        resulting from the vast expansion of derivatives have reemerged with the 
        difficulties of Enron. To be sure, firms like Enron, and Long-Term Capital 
        Management before it, were major players in the derivatives markets. But 
        their problems were readily traceable to an old fashioned excess of debt, 
        however acquired, as well as to opaque accounting of that leverage and 
        lax counterparty scrutiny. Swaps and other derivatives throughout their 
        short history, including over the past eighteen months, have been remarkably 
        free of default. Of course, there can be latent problems in any market 
        that expands as rapidly as these markets have. Regulators and supervisors 
        are particularly sensitive to this possibility. Derivatives have provided 
        greater flexibility to our financial system. But their very complexity 
        could leave counterparties vulnerable to significant risk that they do 
        not currently recognize, and hence these instruments potentially expose 
        the overall system if mistakes are large. In that regard, the market's 
        reaction to the revelations about Enron provides encouragement that the 
        force of market discipline can be counted on over time to foster much 
        greater transparency and increased clarity and completeness in the accounting 
        treatment of derivatives.

How these countervailing forces for stability evolve will surely be a 
        major determinant of the volatility that our economy will experience in 
        the years ahead. Monetary policy will have to be particularly sensitive 
        to the possibility that the resiliency our economy has exhibited during 
        the past two years signals subtle changes in the way our system functions.

[SECTION]

Our most recent experiences underscore this possibility, along with the 
        persistence of a long list of older, well-tested, economic verities. Inventories, 
        especially among producers and purchasers of high-tech products, did run 
        to excess over the past year, as sales forecasts went badly astray; alas, 
        technology has not allowed us to see into the future any more clearly 
        than we could previously. But technology did facilitate the quick recognition 
        of the weakening in sales and backup of inventories. This enabled producers 
        to respond forcefully, as evidenced by output adjustments that have resulted 
        in the extraordinary rate of inventory liquidation we experienced late 
        last year.

[SECTION]

For the period just ahead, the central tendency of the forecasts of the 
        members of the Federal Open Market Committee prepared earlier for our 
        monetary policy report to the Congress was for real GDP to rise 2-1/2 
        to 3 percent during 2002. Such a pace for the growth of real output would 
        be somewhat below the rates of growth typically seen early in previous 
        expansions. Certain factors, such as the lack of pent-up demand in the 
        consumer sector, significant levels of excess capacity in a number of 
        industries, weakness and financial fragility in some key international 
        trading partners, and persistent caution in financial markets at home, 
        seem likely to restrain the near-term performance of the economy.

[SECTION]

In line with past experience during the early stages of expansion, labor 
        market performance was expected initially to lag as firms rely primarily 
        on overtime and shifts from part-time to full-time work. The unemployment 
        rate was anticipated to rise somewhat further over 2002, to the area of 
        6 to 6-1/4 percent. FOMC members evidently anticipated that slack in resource 
        utilization, the lagged effects of past declines in energy prices, and 
        productivity growth will keep inflation low this year, with the price 
        index for personal consumption expenditure increasing about 1-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

Despite its forecast that economic growth is likely to resume at a moderate 
        pace, as I already noted, the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting 
        on January 30 saw the risks nonetheless as continuing to be weighted mainly 
        toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable 
        future. In effect, the FOMC indicated that until the dynamics of sustained 
        expansion are more firmly in place, it remained concerned about the possibility 
        of weak growth for a time, despite the very low level of the federal funds 
        rate.

Although there are ample reasons to be cautious about the economic outlook, 
        the recuperative powers of the U.S. economy, as I have tried to emphasize 
        in my presentation, have been remarkable. When I presented our report 
        on monetary policy to this Committee last summer, few if any of us could 
        have anticipated events such as those to which our nation has subsequently 
        been subjected. The economic consequences of those events and their aftermath 
        are an integral part of the many challenges that we now collectively face. 
        The U.S. economy has experienced a substantial shock, and, no doubt, we 
        continue to face risks in the period ahead. But the response thus far 
        of our citizens to these new economic challenges provides reason for encouragement.
