Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

He had a rare and underappreciated gift for translating arcane and academic theory into real world practice. That ability made a real difference in the conduct and communication of monetary policy. From his work on r*, to the balance sheet, to leading the steering committee for our monetary policy review, Thomas Laubach's intellectual fingerprints are all over the Committee's decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Thomas was also an exceptional colleague, leader, and friend. No one here will be surprised to know that as condolences pour in, the admiration for his kindness and equanimity match, if not exceed, the esteem for his intellect. Thomas was a model of leadership who fiercely believed that every member of his team is critical to our collective success, and he made certain they knew it. Even as he battled his own health problems, working through treatment to help fight the economic fallout of a global pandemic, his concern lay with others. Amid a deluge of emergency work to fight a historic downturn and the upending of daily life, Thomas urged people to take care of themselves and their families first. It is a testament to the mutual respect and amity that it was Thomas's team who proposed the Tealbook dedication in his memory.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","As friends, colleagues, and collaborators, we all grieve his loss. His absence leaves a space that cannot truly be filled. We will miss Thomas Laubach's intellect and his insight. More importantly, we will miss Thomas Laubach.\"\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Vice Chair Williams:\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","\"Thomas and I started working together 20 years ago. He had just arrived at the Board from the Kansas City Fed, and I had returned from my stint at the Council of Economic Advisers. And it was truly serendipitous. We immediately recognized the shared interest in figuring out how to estimate this thing called the natural rate of interest. And more importantly, Thomas was an expert in Kalman filtering. So we were off to the races on that project. Ironically, given subsequent events, the question of the time was whether the productivity boom had driven r* higher. In fact, if you go back to our December 2000 memo, our first memo to the Board on r*, our original estimates had r* at 4-1/4 percent, and that's real, not nominal. So that's a 6-1/4 percent nominal r*. Those were the days.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Jumping ahead 15 years, following his appointment as Director of Monetary Affairs, Thomas would frequently, and very earnestly, ask me how he could be most effective in his role as an adviser to the FOMC. And I'd remind him that the Committee has at times been compared to a herd of cats. But he was always looking for ways to raise his game, and hopefully ours, and help the Committee grapple with issues and decisions before us. Sometimes that effort led to briefings with a labyrinth of charts and figures, where Thomas heroically tried to make sense of our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projections and the implicit policy rule that must be embedded in them if you only looked hard enough. Or it goes without saying how everything makes more sense once you factor in r*.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","His role as trusted adviser was never more on display or important than during the framework review as Chair Powell just commented. Thomas focused on making sure the Committee was prepared with the very best information and analysis. He consistently moved us towards the goal line, even as he engaged in a complex range of issues and dealt with the effects of the pandemic. And he scrupulously played the role of honest broker throughout. Indeed, he perfected the formula for herding cats. It's one part keen intellect, a dollop of understated humor, and a big helping of patience and perseverance.\"\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Governor Clarida:\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","\"Thomas Laubach was a remarkable human being who just happened to be a world class economist. His passing last week represents of course an incalculable loss for his family, but is also a devastating blow felt by each and every one of us in the Federal Reserve System, and indeed, in major central banks around the world that he frequently visited.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Before I arrived at the Board, I knew Thomas primarily through his research. His book on inflation targeting with Ben Bernanke, Rick Mishkin, and Adam Posen is a classic reference on the subject, as is his work with President Williams on r*. I would say Thomas had a talent for picking co-authors. Thomas and I first met when he was a Ph.D. student working on the book and we were both visiting the New York Fed.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","I remember well our first meeting 25 years ago, and I was struck then by Thomas's enthusiasm that he brought to economics as a graduate student. Thomas of course never lost that spark and joy for the practice of monetary policy, and we are all fortunate that he did not. Iâand I'm sure Chair Powell, and before him, Chair Yellenâtrusted him implicitly. And speaking for myself, I always sought his insight and advice privately in my office and counsel on all of the big policy decisions I've had to consider in my two years as Vice Chair.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Thomas made everyone that he worked with better and inspired to put forth their best energy and effort to achieve larger goals. That was most certainly the case in the framework review, and I'll second what Vice Chair Williams and Chair Powell said. Thomas brought peerless leadership, energy, and a commitment to the entire framework review. We simply would not have achieved the evolution of our framework and strategy without Thomas and the insight, inspiration, and good judgment he brought to the project and the ambitious process that he designed and worked with us to implement.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","I understand that in Thomas's last days, he was able to watch the Chair's speech at Jackson Hole rolling out the new framework, and that he was so proud to have been part of what the Wall Street Journal called a landmark change in U.S. monetary policy. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I conclude by saying that it is we who are proud to have had the privilege of working with Thomas Laubach during his 20 years at the Fed. He is and will be deeply missed, but his spirit and inspiration to us all will endure.\"\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations\n","The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. On net, financial conditions eased over the intermeeting period. Equity prices rose and the broad dollar continued to depreciate from its crisis-driven peak in March. Yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities fell, while longer-dated nominal Treasury yields increased modestly.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Market participants attributed these developments to a stronger economic outlook, better news on the COVID-19 trajectory, better-than-feared corporate earnings reports, and accommodative policy. Against this backdrop, most respondents to the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants perceived downside risks to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year as having declined notably since the July survey, and their forecasts for overall growth for 2020 were revised up significantly.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","While the economic outlook had brightened, market participants continued to see significant risks ahead. Some noted concerns about elevated asset valuations in certain sectors. Many also cited geopolitical events as heightening uncertainty. In addition, most forecasters were assuming that an additional pandemic-related fiscal package would be approved this year, and noted that, absent a new package, growth could decelerate at a faster-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter. In light of these and other risks, as well as the ongoing pandemic, market participants continued to suggest that the supportive policy environment and the backstops to market functioning remained important stabilizers.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The release of the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus statement) elicited relatively modest immediate reaction across markets. However, market participants generally viewed the completion of the review as an important milestone; many indicated that growing expectations for the Committee to adopt a flexible average-inflation-targeting regime had influenced asset prices over recent months. In particular, these expectations were viewed as contributing to the recent rise in far-forward measures of inflation compensation, though market participants noted that these measures were still somewhat low by historical standards.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Market participants continued to anticipate that the Committee would update its forward guidance for the federal funds rate. Most respondents to the Desk's surveys continued to indicate that they expected the FOMC to adopt outcome-based forward guidance linked to inflation; some noted that employment measures could be part of the forward guidance as well. Survey respondents' expectations for the economic conditions that would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target range had shifted notably since the previous survey, with many respondents projecting somewhat higher inflation and lower unemployment than in July. Expectations for asset purchases this year remained tightly centered around the current pace; however, many survey respondents revised up the amount of asset purchases expected in 2021 and 2022.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The manager turned next to a discussion of funding market conditions and open market operations over the period. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the period. Overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade in narrow ranges near the interest on excess reserves rate. Forward measures of funding rates implied that conditions were expected to remain stable in coming months.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) continued to function smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other indicators remaining near pre-pandemic levels. Indicators of functioning in the market for agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also remained stable. In light of the improved conditions, the staff proposed that the Desk no longer be required to increase agency CMBS holdings or reinvest principal payments for agency CMBS. For the time being, the Desk would continue to conduct regular agency CMBS operations to maintain backstop capacity.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Staff Review of the Economic Situation\n","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the September 15â16 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was rebounding at a rapid rate in the third quarter. Labor market conditions continued to improve markedly in July and August, but employment was still below its level at the beginning of the year. Consumer price inflationâas measured by the 12âmonth percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through Julyâremained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in July and August, al­though payrolls had retraced only about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate moved down further to 8.4 percent in August. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national average. The labor force participation rate rose, on net, and the employment-to-population ratio increased further in July and August. Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed. In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board's staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from mid-August to early September.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Total PCE price inflation was 1.0 percent over the 12 months ending in July, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices early this year. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.3 percent over the same 12-month period. By comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12âmonth PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in July. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 1.7 percent over the same period. On a monthly basis, recent inflation readings were bolstered by increases in durable goods prices, largely reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods as household purchases shifted away from many consumer services. The latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained within their ranges in recent years. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in July and August, and the three-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations also crept up over the past two months.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Real PCE expanded strongly in July and continued to be bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy actions. In August, the components of retail sales used to estimate PCE, along with sales of light motor vehicles, increased further. However, recent high-frequency indicators of spending on some consumer servicesâsuch as restaurant dining, hotel accommodations, and air travelâwere still subdued. Real disposable personal income was roughly flat in July, primarily reflecting further gains in wage and salary income that were largely offset by the waning of government transfer payments from their peak in the spring. Nevertheless, the personal saving rate remained quite elevated. The consumer sentiment measure from the Michigan survey edged up in August, while the Conference Board survey measure moved down; both measures continued to be below their levels at the beginning of the year.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Housing-sector activity continued to expand, likely supported by the effects of low interest rates. Starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, increased further in July. Sales of both new and existing homes also rose substantially further. These measures of construction and sales were generally at or near their pre-pandemic levels.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Indicators of business fixed investment suggested that this sector was beginning to recover on balance. Nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in July, the third consecutive monthly increase in these indicators of business equipment spending. Many measures of business sentiment also improved somewhat in July and August. In addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early Septemberâan indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sectorâhad flattened out recently following its declines since the spring. In contrast, nominal business spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined over June and July.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Industrial production expanded further in July and August, al­though at a less rapid pace than over the preceding two months. The increase in factory output was broad based, but the gains for most manufacturing industries had slowed gradually since June. Production in the mining sectorâwhich includes crude oil and natural gas drilling and extractionâincreased in July but fell in August, as Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura caused sharp but temporary decreases in extraction and drilling.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Total real government purchases appeared to be increasing modestly, on balance, in the third quarter. Federal defense spending continued to rise through August, and federal employment was boosted markedly by temporary census-related hiring. State and local government payrolls expanded in July and August, al­though nominal state and local construction expenditures decreased in June and July.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","After declining sharply earlier this year, exports and imports of goods and services increased strongly in June and July. On net, over these two months, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened, as imports rose more than exports. Exports and imports of goods rose in June and July in most major product categories, while exports and imports of services rose modestly following previous historic declines.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictive measures to contain it. With some of these measures having been rolled back in recent months, economic indicators pointed to a large, but partial, rebound in most foreign economies in the third quarter. Recent indicators of household and business spending were strong in several economies (including Canada, the euro area, and Brazil), reflecting in part a boost from substantial government support programs. In China, economic indicators showed a continued moderate expansion after a sharp rebound in the second quarter, though gains in consumption continued to lag those in production and exports. Similarly, in Mexico, a strong rebound in manufacturing production contrasted with weak services activity. Despite the widespread rebound in foreign activity indicators, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in parts of Europe and Asia added uncertainty to the outlook for those economies. Recent readings of headline and core inflation abroad remained quite low, particularly in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), amid subdued demand pressures and lower energy prices from earlier this year.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Staff Review of the Financial Situation\n","Financial market sentiment improved over the intermeeting period, boosted by declines in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger-than-anticipated corporate earnings reports and domestic economic data releases. Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, despite notable declines late in the intermeeting period. Inflation compensation increased further, reaching pre-pandemic levels. Changes in other asset prices were generally more modest but were consistent with improved sentiment: The Treasury yield curve steepened a little, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately, and the exchange value of the dollar depreciated modestly. Meanwhile, financing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores remained broadly accommodative, al­though conditions remained tight for other borrowers.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed since the July FOMC meeting, while 10- and 30-year yields rose moderately. Market commentary attributed the increases in longer-term yields to improved investor sentiment. This improved sentiment partly reflected the decline in new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger-than-expected economic data, al­-though market reactions to economic data releases were limited. The near-dated implied volatility on 10-year Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeeting period and remained near the bottom of its historical range. Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS maturing over the next few years continued to increase, likely reflecting the general improvement in investor sentiment accompanying the improvement in the economic outlook, some further improvements in TIPS market liquidity, and the higher-than-expected July CPI data release. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation were close to their pre-pandemic levels but were still in the lower end of their historical ranges.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the July FOMC meeting and remained close to the effective lower bound (ELB) through the first half of 2024. Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate. However, market participants suggested that building expectations that the Committee would move to a form of flexible average inflation targeting under the revised consensus statement had been a factor boosting TIPS inflation compensation over recent months.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, during the intermeeting period, consistent with generally better-than-expected news on both the economy and second-quarter corporate earnings. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500âthe VIXâwas roughly unchanged, on net, al­though measures of longer-term downside risks in equity markets, such as the option-implied cost of insuring against a 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 index in three months, increased somewhat. Spreads of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed somewhat and remained near their historical medians.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors changed little, on net, and remained around levels observed before the pandemic. Total gross CP issuance also remained within pre-pandemic normal ranges, al­though outstanding volumes of nonfinancial CP declined moderately since the July FOMC meeting. Assets under management of prime and government money market funds (MMFs) declined modestly on net. Partly reversing changes observed between April and July, institutional government MMFs, on net, decreased their holdings of Treasury securities and increased their holdings of repurchase agreements (repos) in August. The reversal was driven in part by a tighter spread between Treasury bill yields and repo rates. Amid normalizing market conditions, there was little activity in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or the Commercial Paper Funding Facility.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period. The amount of Federal Reserve repo outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period due to more attractive rates in the private market. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as during the previous intermeeting period.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Foreign asset price movements were generally muted, with market participants likely weighing concerns over rising infection rates in some countries against the prospect of a COVID-19 vaccine. In emerging market economies (EMEs), Asian equity markets significantly outperformed Latin American counterparts, with Chinese equities showing particular strength. In most AFEs, equity indexes rose modestly and long-term sovereign yields edged higher.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","In line with the modest improvement in risk sentiment, the staff's broad dollar index declined moderately, on net, with the dollar depreciating more against EME currencies. The Chinese renminbi was boosted by better-than-expected Chinese economic data and was the most notable contributor to the decline in the staff's trade-weighted dollar index, along with the Mexican peso. Among AFE currencies, the euro appreciated further and reached its highest level against the dollar since 2018. The pound was little changed, as some of its earlier appreciation against the dollar unwound amid a resurgence of Brexit-related uncertainty.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Financing conditions in capital markets remained accommodative over the intermeeting period. Amid historically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds was strong in July and August. Much of this recent issuance was intended to refinance existing debt. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance picked up slightly in July but remained below the levels observed during the same period last year. Amid notable equity market gains in August, gross equity issuance was robust, as seasoned offerings strengthened to about double their typical pace. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding declined in July and August, but at a slower pace than in June, with declines in large part reflecting continued credit-line repayment.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed tentative signs of stabilization over the intermeeting period. The dollar volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades continued to exceed upgrades, albeit only modestly, representing a sizable reduction in net downgrades since the spring. The pace of nonfinancial corporate bond defaults in July was also notably lower than in April and May but was still elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Default volumes fell further in August, reaching a level below the 2019 monthly average. Market indicators of future default expectations also improved somewhat.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, al­though some indicators pointed to a slight improvement. Thirty-day delinquency rates fell modestly between May and July but remained comparable with early 2008 levels. The credit needs of small businesses remained high, with significant shares of respondents to the Census Bureau's Small Business Pulse Survey reporting scarce cash availability and anticipating a need for financial assistance in the next six months.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Municipal market financing conditions remained accommodative since the July FOMC meeting. However, the credit quality of municipal debt deteriorated somewhat, driven by a relatively large volume of credit rating downgrades of revenue bonds.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) intermediated through capital markets recovered further over the intermeeting period. Spreads on triple-B non-agency CMBS remained wide, though they continued to narrow through August, while triple-A spreads remained close to pre-pandemic levels. Issuance of non-agency CMBS was steady but subdued relative to pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on agency CMBS were tight and issuance was very strong, setting a new single-month record in July. In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks was weak in July and August, likely partly driven by the recovery of CMBS markets. Delinquency rates on mortgages backing CMBS fell a bit in July but remained high in the hotel and retail sectors.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. While mortgage rates hovered near historical lows, the spread between primary mortgage rates and MBS yields remained quite wide. Credit continued to flow to higher-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria, while it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products. Nonetheless, low mortgage rates were supporting both home-purchase originations and refinancing. The credit quality of mortgages improved slightly, with the rate of transition into delinquency remaining near pre-pandemic levels and forbearance continuing to slowly decline.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit scores but continued to be tight for subprime borrowers. Auto loan balances increased solidly overall but declined for borrowers with low credit scores. Credit card balances contracted at a slower rate in June and July than in the spring. However, offered interest rates rose and credit limits edged down for credit cards to nonprime borrowers. Conditions in the asset-backed securities (ABS) market were stable during the intermeeting period. ABS spreads edged down, and auto and student loan issuance was robust. Consumer credit performance remained stable, and the share of auto and credit card balances in forbearance declined.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Staff Economic Outlook\n","In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate were faster over the second half of this year than in the July forecast, primarily reflecting recent better-than-expected data. In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected. Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to be subdued this year, reflecting substantial slack in resource utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year. Fiscal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue supporting the second-half recovery, al­though the recovery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end. The staff's forecast assumed the enactment of some additional fiscal policy support this year; without that additional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","In the staff's medium-term projection, the baseline assumptions included that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations, along with voluntary social distancing by individuals and firms, would ease gradually through next year. In addition, the staff projection assumed that monetary policy would be even more accommodative than in the previous forecast in order to more fully reflect the revised consensus statement. Altogether, the rate of real GDP growth was projected to exceed potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline considerably further, and inflation was forecast to pick back up in 2021 through 2023. With the more-accommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty related to the course of the COVIDâ19 pandemic and its associated economic effects was extremely elevated and that the risks to the outlook were still tilted to the downside. Given the apparent resilience of the U.S. economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had previously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline forecast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity, was now less likely than the baseline forecast.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook\n","In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policyâincluding the path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the SEP, which is an addendum to these minutes.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy's medium-term outlook.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants observed that the incoming data indicated that economic activity was recovering faster than expected from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus. In particular, with the reopening of many businesses and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, consumer spending was rebounding sharply and appeared to have recovered about three-fourths of its earlier decline. Prior fiscal policy actions were seen as having supported the ability and willingness of households to spend, al­though most participants expressed concern about the expiration of the enhanced unemployment insurance benefits from the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) and judged that additional fiscal relief would help sustain the recovery in household spending. Indeed, many participants noted that their economic outlook assumed additional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the recovery could be slower than anticipated. Participants also viewed accommodative monetary policy as contributing to gains in residential investment as well as consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods. While participants pointed to strength in consumers' purchases of goods, especially those sold online, they noted that outlays for services had been slower to recover, particularly for items such as air travel, hotel accommodations, and restaurant meals, which had been significantly disrupted by social-distancing measures. Participants generally expected spending on these services to remain subdued for some time and thus to be a restraining factor on the pace of the recovery. A few participants raised the possibility that the unwinding of the large pool of household savings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greater-than-anticipated momentum to consumption going forward. However, a couple of other participants judged that if this savings reflected reduced spending on in-person services by high-income consumers, it was unlikely to provide much momentum to future consumption.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants noted that business investment, which had plummeted in the second quarter, appeared to have begun to turn around. They pointed to data showing gains in capital goods orders and shipments as well as improved business sentiment. A number of participants judged that low interest rates were supporting business investment. However, the recovery was viewed as unevenly distributed across industries. While many business contacts reported progress on adapting to the pandemic, others noted that industries that relied more on person-to-person interactions continued to struggle. Business contacts with ties to the motor vehicle or housing industries indicated increased activity, while those closer to the aviation, hospitality, and nonresidential construction industries were not seeing much of a recovery. Contacts continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sector, as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to China increased.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Al­though business contacts indicated that overall business activity had been stronger than they expected, it remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Business contacts pointed to several factors that could restrain further recovery, including high levels of uncertainty that were reportedly still holding back hiring and capital spending. Some contacts reported difficulties in managing disruptions in supply chains as well as elevated levels of employee absenteeism because of the pandemic. Additionally, District contacts indicated that fiscal policy had helped support small businesses, while federal aid payments had helped support farm incomes.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants observed that labor market conditions continued to improve in recent months and that the economy through August had regained roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April. The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated. Participants judged, however, that the labor market was a long way from being fully recovered. They generally agreed that prospects for a further substantial improvement in the labor market would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses, which in turn would depend importantly on how safe individuals felt to reengage in a wide range of activities. Some participants noted that the majority of gains in employment so far reflected workers on temporary layoffs returning to work. These participants judged it as less likely for future job gains to continue at their recent pace, because a greater share of the remaining layoffs might become permanent. Workers facing permanent layoffs were seen as more likely to need to find new jobs in different industries, and this process could take time, especially to the extent that these workers needed to be retrained.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants observed that lower-paid workers had been disproportionally affected by the economic effects of the pandemic. Many of these workers were employed in the service sector or other industries most adversely affected by social-distancing measures. With a disproportionate share of service-sector jobs held by African Americans, Hispanics, and women, these groups were seen as being especially hard hit by the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. Participants viewed fiscal support from the CARES Act as having been very important in bolstering the financial situations of millions of families, and a number of participants judged that the absence of further fiscal support would exacerbate economic hardships in minority and lower-income communities. In addition, several participants observed that the effects of the pandemic were disrupting the supply of labor because of the need to care for children, many of whom were attending school virtually from home.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","In their comments about inflation, participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased moderately over the intermeeting period, al­though they remained low. The upturn in consumer prices was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors such as consumer durables in which demand had risen after experiencing a large decline earlier this spring. Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still generally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary. While the outlook for inflation was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of participants projected that inflation would run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective for a significant period before moving moderately above 2 percent for some timeâconsistent with the Committee's revised consensus statement.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants noted that financial conditions were generally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Reserve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities in conjunction with the Treasury, were supporting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. While these actions as well as prompt and forceful monetary policy measures in response to the pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommodative financial conditions, participants noted important differences in credit quality and credit availability across borrowers. While the pace of corporate downgrades was seen as having decreased significantly in recent months, the delinquency rates on business loans had risen noticeably. Bank contacts reported ample capacity to lend to creditworthy borrowers; however, surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending was tight. Furthermore, several participants noted the stress that small- and medium-sized banks could face from defaults on loans to small businesses and CRE properties if people continued to withdraw from travel and shopping activities. Additionally, a couple of participants indicated that highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking and to a buildup of financial imbalances.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as very elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it. Participants cited several downside risks that could threaten the recovery. While the risk of another broad economic shutdown was seen as having receded, participants remained concerned about the possibility of additional virus outbreaks that could undermine the recovery. Such scenarios could result in increases in bankruptcies and defaults, put stress on the financial system, and lead to disruptions in the flow of credit to households and businesses. Most participants raised the concern that fiscal support so far for households, businesses, and state and local governments might not provide sufficient relief to these sectors. A couple of participants saw an upside risk that further fiscal stimulus could be larger than anticipated, though it might come later than had been expected. Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that they were committed to using the Federal Reserve's full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. They also noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","All participants agreed that the completion of the framework review and the publication of the revised consensus statement provided a strong foundation for monetary policy decisions and communications going forward. Accordingly, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to incorporate some key elements of the revised consensus statement into the FOMC statement to be released following this meeting. In particular, participants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below its longer-run goal, participants judged that it would be appropriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations would remain well anchored at 2 percent.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Against this backdrop, participants discussed a range of issues associated with providing greater clarity about the likely path of the federal funds rate in the years ahead. Most participants supported providing more explicit outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the federal funds rate above the ELB in terms of the paths for employment or inflation or both. Among the participants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included language indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market conditions were judged to be consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. These participants noted that communicating that the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at the ELB until these criteria were achieved would provide appropriately clear and strong policy guidance. Doing so at this meeting was viewed as an especially important way of affirming the Committee's commitment to achieving the economic outcomes articulated in the consensus statement.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants generally noted that outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate of this type was not an unconditional commitment to a particular path. Indeed, outcome-based guidance of this type would allow the public to infer changes in the Committee's assessment of how long the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at its current setting. Information pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations for a longer period at the current setting of the target range while information suggesting a stronger outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to expectations for a shorter period at the current setting. In addition, circumstances could arise in which the Committee judged that it would be appropriate to change its guidance, particularly if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of its economic objectives.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","A couple of participants preferred even stronger, and less qualified, outcome-based forward guidance that they judged would more clearly convey the Committee's commitment to its objectives and to the strategic approach that was articulated in the revised consensus statement. In particular, these participants preferred forward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the ELB until inflation had moved above 2 percent for some time. Especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run below the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demonstrate the Committee's commitment to achieve outcomes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Several participants noted that while they agreed it was appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consensus statement into the postmeeting statement, they preferred to retain forward guidance similar to that provided in recent FOMC statements. These participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee's revised consensus statement. However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields. Moreover, these participants were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee's flexibility for years. Furthermore, by influencing expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, such guidance could contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that would make it more difficult for the Committee to achieve its objectives in the future.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace. These actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and would continue to help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Some participants also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the Committee's asset purchase program could best support the achievement of the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Participants widely echoed the remarks at the opening of the meeting in memory of Thomas Laubach. Participants universally recognized his great leadership and intellectual contributions to the work of the Committee as well as his warm and generous spirit.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Committee Policy Action\n","In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall, financial conditions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","All members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the Committee's revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Members judged that this action would underscore the Committee's strong commitment to the goals and strategy articulated in the new consensus statement in pursuit of the Committee's statutory objectives. Accordingly, members agreed that the FOMC statement should note that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and that, with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. Almost all members viewed this meeting as the appropriate time to modify forward guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate. To this end, almost all members agreed on a specification for outcome-based forward guidance that indicated that the Committee expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 percent for some time. Two members dissented from the policy decision. One of these dissenting members preferred that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility by retaining the language in the forward guidance provided in the July postmeeting statement; that language noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee was confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The other dissenting member preferred a stronger formulation for the forward guidanceâone in which the Committee would indicate that it expected to maintain the current target range until core inflation had reached 2 percent on a sustained basis.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally agreed that the Committee's policy guidance expressed its assessment about the path for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent with achievement of the Committee's goals, but that it was not an unconditional commitment. They stated that the appropriate rate path would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook. Accordingly, they agreed that the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. Members also agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Members noted that the Committee's asset purchases had helped foster significant improvements in market functioning over recent months. In addition, purchases of securities were contributing to accommodative financial conditions in a way that supported economic recovery. Consistent with these observations, members agreed that it would be appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement the role of asset purchases in supporting accommodative financial conditions. The Committee's statement thus indicated that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and to help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of agency CMBS in the SOMA portfolio. In light of the substantial improvement in market functioning in the agency CMBS market, the Committee judged that it would be appropriate for the Desk to purchase agency CMBS only as needed to sustain smooth market functioning, rather than seek to steadily increase agency CMBS holdings, and to cease reinvestments of agency CMBS principal payments. Members also concluded that, in light of ongoing low take-up at Desk repo operations, it was not necessary to include a sentence on these operations in the FOMC statement. However, the directive adopted by the Committee continued to direct the Desk to conduct overnight and term repo operations to support effective policy implementation and smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","\"Effective September 17, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","\"The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.

President Kashkari dissented because he prefers that the Committee indicate that it expects to maintain the current target range until core inflation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent.

Lorie and I will be splitting the Desk\rbriefing into two parts. I will discuss financial market developments and some issues related\rto open market operations. After questions and answers on this section, Lorie will discuss\rtesting and some related issues with supplementary normalization tools.\rOver the intermeeting period, U.S. economic data were generally viewed as\rpositive and changes in financial conditions were mixed. International developments\rwere in focus with more-accommodative policy adopted or communicated by major\rcentral banks, driven by concerns over low inflation and weak growth. Low inflation\rconcerns were amplified by sharp declines in oil prices. These declines weighed on\rprices of risk assets linked to energy amid a broad reassessment of the possibility for\rstructurally lower oil prices due to supply-side developments as well as ongoing\rglobal growth concerns. These factors also contributed to an increase in realized and\rimplied volatility across markets late in the intermeeting period.\rI thought it would be helpful to look back over the year, as price moves across\rsome major asset classes have been meaningfully different from market expectations\rat the end of last year. While large errors in forecasting asset prices should be\rexpected, the constellation of forecast errors for 2014, shown in the top-left panel, is\rconsistent with easier monetary policy abroad than previously anticipated, a positive\roil supply shock, and a relative outperformance of the U.S. economy. The size of the\runexpected decline in Treasury yields is particularly striking, given that most believe\rthe Federal Reserve is nearing the start of policy normalization around mid-2015.\rOver the remainder of this exhibit, I will focus on two aspects of domestic\rmeasures of longer-dated inflation compensation.\r\r1\r\rThe materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r5 of 219\r\rThe top-right panel shows the market-implied federal funds rate path. Despite\rbetter-than-expected U.S. economic data and some Federal Reserve communications\rthat were perceived as less accommodative than anticipated, market-implied rates\rchanged little on net over the intermeeting period. Looking back further, the curve\rhas shifted down and flattened substantially since the end of 2013 despite ongoing\rimprovements in domestic labor market conditions and notable upward revisions in\rCommittee participants’ SEP federal funds rate paths. This has resulted in a sizable\rdivergence between the market-implied and SEP-projected rate paths.\rThis divergence can be seen in the middle-left panel, which shows the spreads\rbetween median SEP rate projections as of the September meeting and corresponding\rafter the September meeting, and are around their widest levels since rate projections\rwere added to the SEP.\rThe Desk’s most recent surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of\rvarious factors in explaining the difference between the SEP median dots and the\rhighest importance to different outlooks for the U.S. economy, the view that the SEP\rmedian does not represent the Committee’s forecast, and the possibility of remaining\rat the zero lower bound. Negative term premiums and technical factors were\rassigned a lower importance.\rThe middle-right panel uses responses to a range of survey questions, along with\rthe SEP numbers and market-implied rates, to help further identify the importance of\rthese factors. The dark blue bars represent the difference between the median SEP\rdot and the median of the fourth- to seventh-lowest SEP dots, which many market\rparticipants believe most closely align with the likely path of the policy rate. These\rdark blue bars are relatively large, which suggests that a key fact in understanding the\rspread between the median SEP dot and the market-implied path might be that market\rparticipants do not view the median dot as representing the future path of the policy\rrate. The light blue bars represent the difference between the median of the fourth to\rseventh dots and the median of Desk survey respondents’ modal path for the target\rrate. These differences are quite small, which may indicate that market participants\rclose to the Desk survey median have a similar view as to the outlook for the\reconomy and its implications for the target rate as the FOMC participants underlying\rthe median of the fourth to seventh dots. The dark red bars represent the difference\rbetween the mean expectation and the modal expectation for the target rate from the\rDesk’s surveys, which incorporates the perceived possibility of remaining at or\rreturning to the zero lower bound along with other downside risks. In 2016 and 2017,\rthis accounts for around 30 to 35 basis points of the difference between the median\rdifference between the mean of respondents’ federal funds rate probability\rdistributions and the market-implied rate, a measure of risk premiums in futures rates.\rThese differences are very small at earlier horizons but increase substantially in 2017\rto a negative term premium of around 55 basis points.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r6 of 219\r\rIn sum, this panel indicates that the spread between the median SEP forecast and\rthe market-implied rate in 2015 and 2016 may be largely due to differences in the\rperception of the mapping between the SEP dots and the likely path of policy, along\rwith downside risks to modal federal funds rate forecasts. While the more substantial\rdivergence in 2017 might be of less concern because of the uncertainty around threeyear-ahead forecasts, it does line up with the continued decline in medium- and longdated forward rates. One explanation for this decline is an increase in the market\rprice associated with certain types of adverse economic shocks, as described in a\rmemo from the staff at the Minneapolis Fed.\rThe fall in forward rates has been more pronounced in nominal than real rates,\rproducing large declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation. The\rBoard staff’s measures of 5- and 10-year inflation compensation have declined\rroughly 25 to 30 basis points over the period. Both the 5- and 10-year breakeven\rrates, at roughly 1.33 percent and 1.62 percent, respectively, are now at their lowest\rlevels since the height of the euro-area crisis in mid-2010. In addition, the Board\rstaff’s measure of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation, shown in the\rbottom-left panel, is at its lowest level since late 2008, when TIPS market liquidity\rwas highly strained. As we noted at the previous meeting, the sharp declines in these\rdealers’ longer-term inflation expectations, also shown in this panel, and with other\rsurvey-based measures. While not all market measures of forward inflation\rcompensation are as low as the one estimated by Board staff, many of them suggest\rlonger-dated inflation risk premiums are negative under the assumption that long\rforward inflation expectations remain well anchored near the FOMC’s longer-run\rinflation objective.\rAmid the relative stability of survey-based inflation measures, the Desk surveys\ragain asked respondents to decompose the decline in the market-based five-year, fiveyear-forward breakeven inflation rate since early September, in an attempt to capture\rviews about sentiments underlying market pricing. The bottom-right panel shows\rthat dealer and buy-side respondents, on average, attributed roughly half of the\rin the inflation risk premium and other risk premiums. This decomposition is similar\rto that for the October surveys.\rFactors cited in the surveys as contributing to lower market inflation expectations\rinclude declines in energy prices, appreciation of the U.S. dollar, and concerns about\rglobal growth and inflation. More marginally, some market participants have cited\rconcerns that the Federal Reserve may tighten policy before the economy is\rsufficiently resilient to withstand higher interest rates. Some have also suggested that\rthe deteriorating TIPS market liquidity may be a factor behind the narrowing in\rbreakeven inflation rates. However, Desk analysis suggests there was relatively little\rchange in market functioning over most of the intermeeting period, though poor\rliquidity may have exacerbated the particularly pronounced drop in breakeven\rinflation rates late last week.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r7 of 219\r\rThe top-left panel of your next exhibit shows that measures of forward inflation\rcompensation declined in other developed economies over the course of this year,\rthough Japanese measures are little changed. Forward inflation compensation\rother factors. Low inflation, along with declining inflation expectations and weak\reconomic growth abroad, has motivated a variety of more-accommodative monetary\rpolicy actions or communications outside of the United States. This has furthered the\rdivergence in the expected policy rate paths between the Federal Reserve and other\rcentral banks in developed countries.\rTo encourage inflation and stimulate the economy in Japan, the BOJ unexpectedly\rannounced an expansion of its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing, or\rQQE, program to limit deflationary risks, and Prime Minister Abe took steps to\rpostpone the second planned consumption tax increase. Both the size and timing of\rthe BOJ announcement surprised market participants, leading to a sharp depreciation\rof the yen, increase in Japanese equity prices, and decline in 30-year Japanese\rgovernment bond yields, as shown in the top-right panel.\rThe BOJ decision coincided with an announcement from the Government Pension\rInvestment Fund (GPIF) indicating that it would reduce its portfolio allocation to\rdomestic bonds and increase its allocation to equities and international fixed-income\rassets by more than expected. Most market participants expect other Japanese\rpensions to follow the GPIF strategy, which could result in roughly $90 billion and\r$175 billion being reallocated toward U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. equities,\rrespectively, over the next year.\rConcerns over low inflation in the euro area also motivated more-accommodative\rcommunications from the ECB Governing Council. At its November meeting, the\rGoverning Council explicitly stated its intention to increase the size of the ECB\rbalance sheet toward early 2012 levels, which will require a roughly 1 trillion euro\rexpansion, as shown in the middle-left panel. A subsequent speech from President\rDraghi bolstered expectations that the ECB will purchase sovereign bonds. Many\rinsufficient to increase the balance sheet toward early 2012 levels or sufficiently raise\rinflation expectations. Indeed, take-up in the ECB’s recently announced targeted\rlonger-term refinancing operations has been toward the lower end of market\rexpectations. In response, market participants have increased the probability they\rattach to a sovereign bond purchase program in the first quarter of next year.\rOver the intermeeting period, front-month crude oil futures prices declined\raround 30 percent and longer-dated oil futures prices declined 15 to 20 percent.\rsupply dynamics, particularly the recent OPEC decision to maintain current\rproduction levels amid faster-than-expected growth in U.S. shale output.

This spread widening may also reflect recent elevated high-yield issuance\rand a reported increase in credit differentiation as domestic policy normalization\rapproaches.\rThe bottom-left panel shows U.S. dollar appreciation against major developed\reconomies and large non-dollarized oil exporting countries over the intermeeting\rperiod and year-to-date. The U.S. dollar appreciation against major developed\reconomy currencies, shown in solid shades of blue, is largely due to diverging\rmonetary policy expectations and growth outlooks. U.S. dollar appreciation against\rlarge petroleum exporting countries, shown in dashed shades of blue, largely reflects\rthe impact of lower oil prices on these local economies.\rThe Russian ruble, not shown in the chart due to its extremely large moves, has\rdepreciated significantly, especially over the past couple of days. The depreciation\rreflects a combination of low oil prices and the effect of western sanctions and\rongoing tensions in Ukraine. This, along with the increased possibility of defaults on\rthe large stock of foreign-currency-denominated corporate debt, is leading to\rincreased financial-stability risk in Russia. In response to the recent depreciation, the\rRussian central bank increased its main policy rate from 10.5 percent to 17 percent on\rMonday night.\rThe recent declines in oil prices and concerns over global growth have weighed\ron emerging market risk assets, as shown in the bottom-right panel, and declines in\rEM asset prices accelerated late in the intermeeting period. In contrast, there has\rrecently been a meteoric rise in the Shanghai Composite Index, also shown in this\rpanel. The Shanghai index has risen nearly 20 percent following an interest rate cut\rby the PBOC in mid-November. This rate cut increased market expectations for\rfurther PBOC easing amid the subdued mainland inflation prints and activity data.\rTurning to Desk operations, negative interest rates on eligible euro-area\rinvestments continue to present challenges to the management of the SOMA euro\rforeign reserves portfolio. The approach taken to reduce the influence of negative\rinterest rates on the portfolio’s return has resulted in an increase in the duration of the\rportfolio, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit. As discussed in a memo\rdistributed before the meeting, the Desk would like to make some changes to the euro\rportfolio investment strategy to better balance the tradeoff between maintaining\rmaturity liquidity and earning interest income in a negative interest rate environment.\rAssuming the rate structure in France and Germany doesn’t move lower, this revised\rinvestment strategy would likely allow us to keep the duration of the portfolio below\rthe FOMC-authorized limit of 18 months. However, that 18-month limit will\rconstrain our ability to implement the revised strategy if French and German interest\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r9 of 219\r\rrates fall further. To avoid a situation in which the current duration limit becomes a\rbinding constraint on the investment strategy in the negative interest rate\renvironment, we plan to recommend that the FOMC increase the duration limit from\r18 to 24 months. The Desk views the reauthorization of the foreign operations at the\rTurning to the top-right panel, with the end of the asset purchase program in\r$2.5 trillion in Treasury securities and about $1.8 trillion in MBS. Rollovers of\rTreasury securities and reinvestments of agency principal payments will maintain the\rpar value of the portfolio at its current level until these policies are ended. For\rcontext, only about $3 billion in Treasury holdings will mature in 2015, but the staff\restimates that principal paydowns on MBS and maturing agency debt will total\ralmost $300 billion next year. MBS reinvestment operations have generally gone\rsmoothly, although in mid-November the Desk cancelled an MBS operation due to a\rtechnical glitch. The problem was subsequently resolved, and the operation was\rsuccessfully completed a few days later.\rAdditionally, the Desk began trading today with the three small firms that are\rparticipating in the Mortgage Operations Counterparty Pilot Program, as part of our\rongoing efforts to explore ways to broaden access to open market operations and\rimprove operational capacity and resiliency.\rThe Desk continues to take other steps to enhance our operational readiness. We\rplan to conduct small-value sales of MBS early next year. In addition, with\rtremendous support from the management and staff at FRB Chicago, the Markets\rGroup has replicated the infrastructure and human capital necessary to ensure the\rimplementation of all operations, market monitoring, and associated analytical work\rdeemed critical should the New York Fed and its staff be affected by a serious\rcontingency event.\rAt the previous meeting I discussed a new service the Federal Reserve could offer\rknown as segregated balance accounts (SBAs). The discussion of this service in the\rrecall, SBAs are designed to improve competition in the deposit market. The\rmechanism through which they would improve competition is similar to, but different\rin important respects from, the use of RRPs. Many market participants interpreted\rthe discussion in the minutes as suggesting SBAs would receive important regulatory\rrelief which would substantially lower the balance sheet costs of attracting funds into\rsuch accounts. As you know, such relief was not part of the plan for the service,\ralthough some other types of regulatory decisions were required for SBAs to be\rviable. In addition, various system changes would be required. The staff currently\rjudges that in light of the competing priorities related to normalization and the small\rother tools, further work on implementing SBAs should be shelved for now. This\rjudgment is supported by the reaction to a request for feedback on continuing work\ron SBAs in a memo that Bill English and I sent to the Committee.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r10 of 219\r\rMadam Chair, this completes my part of the Desk briefing. We would be happy\rto answer questions before moving on to Lorie’s part.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Questions for Simon? President Fisher.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a short question, and I also have a\rclarification which will require a longer question. On slide number 10, you have the high yield\rOAS. And if I did my numbers right, just looking at the red line, the broad index is off 22\rpercent. If memory serves, energy is off about 68 percent. You mentioned it’s about 18 percent\rof the index, I think—it’s a heavy weight. I just wanted to clarify that. The index altogether is\roff by 22 percent, and, excluding energy, it would be something around 15 or 16 percent. I just\rwant to clarify that. So it’s mainly energy-driven.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. I’m not as good with numbers in my head as you are. That sounds about\rright.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Well, you’re much better with bigger numbers than I am, but just for\rclarification I think that’s correct.\rSo we read about panic—which we have been warning about, Madam Chair, at this\rtable—at least I have, for quite some time. I believe we are beginning to see that, but it is\rheavily concentrated with marginal energy operators. I think that needs to be understood, and\rI’m going to talk a little bit about oil during the economic go-round. I just want to put that in\rcontext.\rAnd then, with regard to numbers, you did send around to the research directors an\rexcellent, very insightful memo which gives more background to your slide number 14. And\rthese are numbers I know you’re familiar with, so I just want to make sure I understand them,\rbecause you referenced them just now.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Okay.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r11 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. So you just said we have $2.3 trillion in Treasuries and about $1.8 trillion\rin mortgage-backed securities. Is that correct?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. It’s $2.5 trillion in Treasuries, I thought.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Okay, $2.5 trillion. That’s even better. We have only about $3 billion in\rTreasury redemptions in 2015, so nothing to speak of—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. That’s correct.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. —until 2016. And then, in this memo, which, again, was superb as far as\rI’m concerned, but here is where I get into the stuff I just want to make sure I understand and my\rcolleagues understand. So we estimate paydown reinvestments from mortgage-backed securities\rfor 2015 will be approximately $20 billion per month.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Maybe a little bit higher, but about that level.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. And your memo says that’s 25 percent of gross issuance and three times\rnet issuance.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Correct.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. That’s as long as we keep our mortgage-backed securities at about\r$1.8 trillion, until we change our reinvestment policy. Then, in the memo you use the\rprepayment speed projections of BlackRock Solutions, and we project that by August 2021, we\rwill have an MBS portfolio of $980 billion and a 90 percent confidence band around that of $700\rbillion to $1.16 trillion. So, in other words, we’d halve our mortgage-backed security portfolio\rin a period of five years.\rThe stated intention of the Committee right now is to not let these reinvestments roll off\runtil after we have raised rates, whenever that is going to be, whenever we begin to normalize.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r12 of 219\r\rSo it’s really taking five years, and, therefore, we would reduce by $900 billion over that fiveyear period. Correct?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Yes. That’s the point estimate, with a lot of uncertainty around it.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Right. But you illustrated that, and you have a 90 percent confidence\rband around that. Then, concomitantly, on excess reserves, you noted that they will be reduced\rfrom their current level. We thought at the peak it would be $2.95 trillion, but it’s $2.5 trillion,\rwhatever the number is. Where is it now?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. It depends on the take-up in the TDF and the overnight RRP. So because\rthe $400 billion TDF rolled off, we should add probably $400 billion to that number. So it’s\raround $2.8 trillion to $2.9 trillion.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Okay. And we expect to reduce it to what you call the normal level of\r$100 billion by mid-2021. So over a six-year period, we will have gone from $2.9 trillion to\r$100 billion in excess reserves. I just want to make sure I understand the numbers. That’s a lot.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Yes.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Thank you. I hope the Committee realizes all these numbers. This is\rvery important to me. That’s asking a lot. To reduce by that size over that short of a time\rperiod, it’s going to require our successors, meaning President Plosser’s and my successors, and\ryou all and your successors, to be very artful—and I’m trying to think through, how are those\rexcess reserves going to be reduced by 95 percent? That’s a big number. I would like the\rCommittee just to start thinking about that.\rI would urge everybody to read this research-director memo. It’s one of the most\renlightening documents I have read yet. Simon has written a lot of enlightening documents, but\rthis one is particularly good because it puts this all in perspective. We’re talking about big\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r13 of 219\r\rswings, and I think we just need to realize the order of difficulty and the art form it is going to\rrequire to pull it off. And that’s why I mentioned it to you. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Other questions or comments? President Kocherlakota.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Madam Chair. I had a comment on slide 4, which\rI thought was quite interesting. I would be interested in seeing this for other meetings beyond\rthe current one. I think it would help make the point that markets are focusing on other aspects\rof the SEP than the median. So what would this chart look like if we went back to September\rand to June, that kind of thing?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. If you look at chart 3, you can see that it is really in July that this\rdivergence starts. So the chart is going to be less interesting or require us to have positive term\rpremiums or something else to produce these results.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. So the problem I was having with understanding slide 4 is that\rthere’s lots of different stories I can construct to explain—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. That’s right. This is just one way of taking a number and splitting it up\rinto four parts. There are many ways you could split a number into four parts.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Right. And I thought it would be more compelling if it\ractually worked for other meetings beyond this one.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Again, what I was trying to focus on is—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Just this divergence.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. —there’s this big divergence recently. And we could go back and look\rat the history of the fourth to seventh versus the median dot—what was definitely true and\rstriking to me is that until recently, if I took the mean of the PDF for the federal funds rate\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r14 of 219\r\rdistributions, then that lined up pretty well with the market-implied path. Sometime in late\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Right. I’ll note, Madam Chair, just for your amusement, that\rthe implied federal funds rate for the end of 2017 is 2 percent, which corresponds to the lowest\rnumber, I think, on the SEP, in fact. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Not adjusting for term premiums and the other stuff.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. No. That’s right.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. But then, when you adjust it, you get back to that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. President Bullard.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Madam Chair. My question is on exhibit 1, panels 5 and\r6, which are about U.S. inflation expectations. I’m looking at panel 5, and it shows that the\rprimary dealer inflation expectation, five-year, five-year-forward, is 2.2 percent. And then I look\rat panel 6 and it says, if I’m interpreting this correctly, that the primary dealers are saying that\rtheir expectations went down 17 basis points on expected inflation. No? Is that not right?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. This is a question that came up last time. We asked them for their view\rof what CPI inflation will be five years forward, over the next five years after that. Then we\rasked them to explain what the market pricing is. So we are trying to get their beliefs or\runderstanding of what in market sentiment is driving the drop in inflation compensation.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Okay. But, you know, panel 5 says none of the primary dealers\rchanged any of their expectations about inflation. That’s what that light blue line says, I guess.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. That is correct.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. But, nevertheless, there are other traders in the market whose\rexpectations—so that sounds like a money-making arbitrage opportunity for primary dealers.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r15 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. They could go and talk to their trading desks and see if they wanted to\rput on such a trade. It would seem that they would have to be pretty confident about the source\rto do that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. It’s not risk-free.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. No, it’s far from risk-free. It’s not a risk-free arbitrage.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Well, it speaks to how seriously you want to take the idea that they\rhaven’t changed their inflation expectations. They tell you in a survey, “I haven’t changed my\rinflation expectations, but I’m not willing to go bet against the market.”\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. That’s right.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Yes. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. I think that this gets back to something that we learned during the taper\rtantrum—that what we mean by “market expectations” isn’t really clear. There isn’t a person\rwho is the market who has a set of expectations. There are a bunch of diverse market\rparticipants who each have their own expectations, and you can have a situation in which the\raverage market participant has a set of expectations, but the marginal investor has a different set\rof expectations. And that is something that we try to tease out with these surveys and in\rconversations with people and by reading newsletters. But it just is a complicated problem.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Well, I think it’s a point well taken. Obviously, there is a diverse set\rof expectations out there, but I think, from the Committee’s point of view—sometimes we look\rat our primary dealer survey and we say, “Well, this is kind of the authoritative judgment on\rwhether these expectations are really changing or not.” And I don’t think that’s necessarily the\rway that we want to interpret the data.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r16 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. One of the things we did is add more participants in the surveys, just to\rsee. And you can see a slight difference in focus between the buy-side and the dealers here. But\rthey are both pretty consistent in thinking half of this, in the market’s mind—whatever that is—\rhas to do with a fall in inflation expectations. It’s the same as in the October one.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. President Evans.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Thank you, Madam Chair. I’m a little embarrassed to ask this question.\rI’m going to blame it on the very interesting charts on the SEP dots four through seven that\rdistracted me as I tried to extract a little bit of what that was. So I might have missed the\rexplanation later on.\rYou started off in chart 1 describing how the 10-year rates had gone down so much more\rthan anybody was expecting at the beginning of the year, and I don’t quite recall the explanation\roffered as to why they have gone down so much. I think at one point you mentioned anticipated\reasier monetary policy. You probably mentioned lower inflation and oil supply, weak demand\rwas mentioned in another case. Do you want to give me an executive summary of that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. The forecast error for the U.S. 10-year is not that big. The absolute error\rover the past 10 years is about 93 basis points. For the bund, I think it is more like 80 basis\rpoints, and that is consistent with thinking something will change in the euro area. So one of the\rreasons to show this is to remind ourselves that forecasting the future is really hard, and even if\rwe get these experts, they are going to be wrong a lot. The second one is to show that there is a\rdistinct pattern here, which is easier policy probably in Germany and Japan than people thought\rwas going to happen at the start of the year, a big drop in the price of oil, and the U.S. doing\rrelatively better. So if I told you everything except the top line on the list and said, “Guess\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r17 of 219\r\rwhere the U.S. 10-year rate would be,” you’d probably say, “Well, I’m going to take my\restimate of 3.23 percent and make it a little bit higher than that.” That’s the part that is\rsomewhat surprising.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. But if I think the long-term rates are low because the world economy is\rnot so well, it becomes—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Well, that’s one portion of it, yes.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. —a decoupling type of hypothesis. I’m not sure I would have—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. So that’s one hypothesis.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Yes. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Further questions for Simon? Okay. Seeing none, let me turn to\rLorie, who is going to discuss normalization-related topics.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. LOGAN. Thank you, Madam Chair. I’ll begin again on exhibit 3 with a\rsummary of the recent testing of the term deposit facility and reverse repos, and a\rstaff proposal to continue ON RRP testing in 2015. These items were discussed in\rtwo of the staff memos you received ahead of the meeting.\rOver the intermeeting period, the staff completed a series of eight TDF test\roperations that included an early withdrawal option. Including an early withdrawal\roption allowed banks to count term deposits as HQLA for purposes of the Liquidity\rCoverage Ratio. The first few operations in the series provided a test of the\rattractiveness of an early withdrawal option, as the maximum award amount and TDF\rrate were the same as in previous operations. Consistent with the feedback from\rbanks before the series was initiated, allotment amounts in these operations with the\roption increased notably.\rSubsequent operations in the series, shown in the dark blue line in the middle-left\rpanel, also incorporated a higher maximum award amount and incremental increases\rin the TDF rate. Take-up in these operations rose, on average, by an increase of\r$35 billion per basis point in the TDF rate. More broadly, the increased participation\rin these operations relative to those without the early withdrawal option, shown in the\rlight blue line, was driven by both the introduction of the early withdrawal option and\rthe higher maximum award amounts. The staff will continue to evaluate the results\rof the most recent series of operations in developing options for additional TDF\rtesting next year.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r18 of 219\r\rOver the intermeeting period, the Desk proceeded with testing of both term and\rovernight reverse repos as directed by the Committee. The details of these operations\rare shown in the middle-right panel for your reference. So far, operations have\rproceeded smoothly. The announcement and conduct of term RRP operations to date\rprovide a preliminary indication that term RRPs could be an effective supplementary\rtool for mitigating the effects of year-end dynamics on money market rates.\rAdditionally, recent overnight RRP testing has reinforced the idea that increases in\rthe ON RRP offering rate put upward pressure on both secured and unsecured\rovernight rates. The coming weeks will provide a useful test of how these\rsupplementary tools could work in combination to support interest rate control over\ryear- and quarter-ends.\rWith respect to the term RRP operations, the Desk conducted two of the four\rannounced operations. As shown in the bottom-left panel, counterparties placed\r$102 billion and $75 billion in bids in the first two operations, respectively.\rParticipants generally viewed the award rates for the two operations, which were\r8 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively, as roughly equivalent to their\rexpectations for ON RRP rates through January 5, plus a small term premium to\rcompensate for locking up liquidity. Dealers and money market funds expect the\raward rate to fall further as operations approach year-end.\rBased on the operations conducted so far, some firms appear to be substituting\rfunds that they would otherwise invest in ON RRP operations into the term\roperations. Looking at the bottom-right panel, prime and government money funds\roperations—shown by the red bars—by an amount that was roughly similar to their\rallotment in the term operations, which are represented by the blue bars. As a result\rof this substitution, the total amount of reverse repos outstanding, including both term\rand ON RRPs, is currently $135 billion, which is actually a bit lower than the take-up\rin ON RRPs just before the term operations began.\rWhile we will learn more in coming weeks, the term RRP operation results to\rdate, combined with anecdotal reports and the relatively benign expectations for yearend stress implied by market-based measures currently, together suggest that the use\rof term RRP operations over year-end may moderate some of the volatility in money\rThe Desk also completed the directed series of ON RRP operations that involved\rmodest, pre-announced changes in the offering rate. While several other factors also\raffected money market rates during the testing period, the tests provided further\rindication that ON RRPs provide a soft floor for both secured and unsecured money\rAs shown in the top-left panel of your last exhibit, the increases in the ON RRP\roffering rate to 7 basis points and 10 basis points corresponded with increases in\rsecured and unsecured rates, including the federal funds effective rate.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r19 of 219\r\rThe distribution of rates on federal funds trades, shown in the top-right panel, also\rshifted higher with each increase in the overnight RRP rate. For example, when the\rovernight RRP rate was 5 basis points, as shown in the dark blue line, less than 1\rpercent of brokered federal funds trades occurred below the overnight RRP rate. As\rthe overnight RRP offering rate was increased to 10 basis points, the distribution\rshifted higher, and again only about 1 percent of trades took place below the new\rovernight RRP offering rate.\rduring the testing period was primarily due to increased bargaining power by FHLBs.\rMoreover, it does not appear as if FHLBs had to change their behavior meaningfully\rin order to obtain higher rates. Participation by FHLBs in overnight RRP\roperations—the dark blue line in the middle-left panel—was largely unchanged\rduring the testing period. More broadly, federal funds trading volumes—the red line\rin the same panel—also remained stable. Stable federal funds volumes alongside a\rhigher federal funds effective rate could also indicate that foreign banking\rorganizations are still willing to participate in IOER arbitrage at a spread to the IOER\rrate that is narrower than its level prior to the changes in the overnight RRP rate.\rThis suggests that balance sheet costs may not be the primary factor currently\raffecting the rate at which FBOs borrow federal funds outside of key financial\rreporting dates. Imperfect competition among banks may also play a role in\rdetermining the rates at which they borrow funds in order to conduct IOER arbitrage.\rSecured rates, including the triparty repo rates, shown in the middle-right panel,\ralso shifted up in response to the move in the overnight RRP rate. This rise in rates\rpartially reflected the increased bargaining power of a broader set of cash lenders.\rHowever, other factors, such as changes in collateral supply and GSE cash\rmanagement needs, also reportedly put upward pressure on repo rates, particularly\rearly in the testing period when the overnight RRP rate was 5 basis points.\rWhile these changes to the overnight RRP rate have been informative, additional\rtesting of overnight RRPs could further improve our understanding of this\rsupplementary tool. As outlined in the bottom-left panel, the staff recommends\rextending overnight RRP testing through January 2016. Doing so would provide\rcontinuity in the usage of the tool, particularly given investors’ reported emphasis on\rdeveloping relationships so as to ensure ongoing access to their counterparties’\rbalance sheets. If the operations were to cease in January, it is possible that, at the\rbeginning of normalization, frictions in reestablishing these relationships could\rtemporarily hamper the efficacy of an overnight RRP facility. Additionally, ending\rovernight RRP testing could be read by some investors as suggesting that\rnormalization remains a longer way off or that the Committee might be reconsidering\rthe use of overnight RRPs during normalization. Further, since we have conducted\rrelatively few operations at rates above 5 basis points, it may be instructive to\rcontinue testing the tool at overnight rates between 5 and 10 basis points to learn\rmore about the size and durability of the resulting market effects, or to test at even\rhigher rates to see if similar effects hold. For these reasons, along with the continued\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r20 of 219\r\rbenefits of promoting operational readiness, we recommend extending the overnight\rRRP exercise for another year.\rAs discussed in the revised memo sent to the Committee on Friday, we would like\rto do so at this meeting, since the current resolution expires only two days after the\r“Overnight Reverse Repurchase Resolution.” 2 Apart from the change in the terminal\rdate, the draft resolution reflects minor wording changes from the resolution adopted\rby the Committee at its September 2014 meeting, and maintains the 0 to 5 basis point\rrange in the overnight RRP offering rate. If the change in the resolution is approved,\rthe FOMC minutes would inform the public of the extension. Additionally, if the\rchange is approved, the staff will recommend some additional tests at upcoming\rmeetings, after we have had a chance to fully assess the results of the current tests.\rLastly, as discussed at the October meeting, the Desk reopened the overnight RRP\rcounterparty process for firms meeting the existing eligibility requirements, and we\rwanted to provide a brief update on the results. As shown in the bottom-right panel,\r25 eligible firms submitted applications, including 12 money market funds, 7 banks,\r5 FHLBs, and Farmer Mac. If the legal, credit, and compliance assessments of all\rapplicants prove satisfactory, the total number of expanded RRP counterparties will\rincrease to 142. This number incorporates the fact that we had one firm withdraw as\ra counterparty during the intermeeting period. It was a fairly idiosyncratic\rcircumstance that prompted the withdrawal and is unlikely to be an indication of a\rbroader trend. We plan to announce the new set of counterparties in mid-January and\rbegin operating with them shortly thereafter. Thank you, Madam Chair. That\rconcludes my prepared remarks.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Are there questions for Lorie? President Mester.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. MESTER. Lorie, I know you revised the memo, and I still don’t fully understand\rwhy we need to extend the resolutions for the testing until January 2016. I think it could be\rconfusing because we are thinking about lifting off in that time period, and I’m just wondering\rwhether it might be better to do a sequence of resolutions so that we don’t confuse markets about\rwhat our intention is with liftoff. Can you explain that a little bit more for me?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. LOGAN. I think certainly another option could be to vote at each meeting or to\rmove this decision into the directive.

I think the calculus we went through was to start by saying, gee, if it\rreally seemed like we wanted to lift off, and if things go as expected until midyear, maybe you\rjust extend it until midyear. But then it kind of does look like maybe you’re signaling something\rabout the timing of liftoff. So we thought by just making it a calendar year, that makes it seem\rbasically mechanical. We’re just extending this thing for a year, and we can say, if asked, “Of\rcourse this is a tool we’re going to use during normalization.” Whenever normalization happens,\rwe’ll be changing the terms on which we’re going to be doing overnight RRP, but—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS.

Let me turn things\rover to John Stevens.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STEVENS. 3 Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be referring to the handout\rtitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”\rThe first exhibit summarizes recent information on the labor market. The two\remployment reports that we have received since the October meeting were stronger\rthan we had expected. As shown in panel 1, payroll employment gains averaged\r278,000 per month over the past three months, 44,000 more per month than we had\rprojected in the October Tealbook. In response, we have marked up our payroll\rforecast to 250,000 in December and 220,000 per month in the first quarter. The\runemployment rate, plotted in panel 2, held steady at 5.8 percent in November but\rhas fallen more than 1 percentage point over the past 12 months and, by our\restimation, is currently about ½ percentage point above its natural rate. We expect\rthe unemployment rate to edge down in December and to average 5.5 percent in the\rfirst quarter.\r\r3\r\rThe materials used by Messrs. Stevens and Erceg are appended to this transcript (appendix 3).\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r24 of 219\r\rThe middle panels display two labor market indicators that, in our judgment, point\rto some recent improvement but also suggest more slack than is indicated by the\runemployment rate. As shown in panel 3, the labor force participation rate (the black\rline) is below both the staff’s estimate of its trend (the green line) and the level\rpredicted by a simple regression of the participation rate on the current and lagged\rvalues of the output gap (the red line). Similarly, panel 4 indicates that the share of\rworkers reporting that they are working part time for economic reasons remains\rconsiderably above the level we might expect given the output gap.\rOther labor market indicators also suggest that conditions are continuing to\rimprove. As shown by the black line in panel 5, the rate of job openings in the\rJOLTS has risen sharply this year. Meanwhile, both the hiring rate (the red line) and\rthe quits rate (the blue line) have moved up as well. Panel 6 provides results from a\rrecent inquiry conducted by the Reserve Banks about the hiring plans of their\rbusiness contacts. As noted on the first row of the table, the average share of firms\rplanning to increase hiring over the next 12 months moved up to 52 percent, the\rhighest reading since we started asking this question several years ago. Among firms\rplanning to increase hiring, more than one-fourth plan to raise starting pay to help\rwith recruiting, a noticeably higher share than in early 2013. The reported\rwillingness to raise starting pay may, as shown in the last line of the table, reflect\rincreases in the share of firms reporting difficulties finding workers with the required\rskills. As noted in a box in the Tealbook, “Indicators of Labor Shortages,” other\revidence also points to increasing instances of skill shortages, but the extent to which\rsuch shortages are restraining hiring and production appears to be about in line with\rwhat one would expect given measures of labor market and product market slack.\rThe next exhibit summarizes other recent economic developments and provides\ran update to our near-term GDP forecast based on information received after we\rclosed the Tealbook projection. As shown in the inset box in panel 1, the PCErelevant portion of retail sales for November was stronger than we had expected, and\rthe gains for earlier months were revised up. In addition, households’ consumption\rof health-care services during the third quarter looks set to be revised up as well. All\rtold, as shown by the blue bars, we now estimate that real PCE rose at an annual rate\rof 2¾ percent in the third quarter and forecast that it will increase about 4 percent this\rquarter. The projected pickup this quarter reflects the stronger retail sales data,\rhigher-than-expected motor vehicle sales, and a rebound in energy services spending,\rwhich had been held down in the third quarter by unusually cool summer weather.\rWe continue to expect real PCE to increase about 3½ percent in the first quarter,\rsupported by ongoing improvements in employment, household wealth, and\rconsumer sentiment, as well as by the boost to real incomes from the drop in energy\rprices.\rIn the housing market, panel 2, this morning’s data on single-family starts (the red\rlines) edged down, and adjusted permits (the black lines) were about unchanged. On\rnet, the data we have received over the past few months have continued to disappoint\rand are consistent with only gradual increases in housing construction over the near\rterm. Nonetheless, we remain steadfast in our assessment that the current low level\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r25 of 219\r\rof construction activity will not be sustained as the strengthening job market and\rdiminishing concerns about the economic outlook eventually fuel a recovery in\rhousehold formation that will boost the demand for new housing.\rAs shown in panel 3, shipments of nondefense capital goods (the black line) were\rlittle changed, on net, over the past three months, while orders (the red line) declined.\rHowever, with orders running above shipments, we continue to expect investment in\requipment and intangibles to rise modestly in the near term.\rAs shown in the inset box in panel 4, mining output was little changed in\rthe fourth and first quarters after having risen at a 13 percent pace during the\rpreceding three quarters. This sharp deceleration reflects slower gains in oil and gas\rextraction and a projected decline in drilling activity. Manufacturing production\rjumped more than 1 percent in November, which was stronger than we had been\ranticipating, and we now expect manufacturing output to increase at a robust average\rpace of more than 5 percent per quarter in the fourth and first quarters. These\rprojected gains are consistent both with a step-up in automakers’ assembly schedules\rin the first quarter (not shown) and with the new orders diffusion indexes plotted in\rpanel 5. Although the range of readings on new orders in November was unusually\rwide, all of the indexes were in positive territory, and the central tendency of these\rindexes points to solid increases in production over the next few months.\rAs indicated on line 1 of panel 6, after folding in the recent information for PCE\rreceived following the close of the Tealbook projection, we now estimate that real\rGDP increased at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the third quarter and that growth\rwill step down to an average pace of 2½ percent this quarter and next. Relative to the\rthird and fourth quarters but little revised in the first quarter. The step-down in\rgrowth this quarter continues to largely reflect a swing in the contributions from net\rexports and from federal defense spending. Excluding these volatile spending\rcategories, the rate of increase in private domestic final purchases (PDFP), line 4,\raverages about 3½ percent throughout the near term and does not show the slowdown\rfrom the third quarter that we see for real GDP.\rExhibit 3 describes our medium-term forecast and, for a longer perspective,\rreviews how that forecast has changed from one year ago. As shown in panel 1, our\rcurrent Tealbook projection is for real GDP growth (the black line) to average\r2½ percent per year from 2015 to 2017. Compared with our forecast from this time\rlast year (the red dashed line), this projection is about ¾ percentage point weaker per\ryear on average.\rAt the same time, as shown in panel 2, the unemployment rate fell more rapidly\rover the past year than we had projected in December 2013, and we have marked\rdown the projected path. This change, in an environment of still relatively lackluster\rGDP growth, led us to mark down our estimates of potential output growth. Indeed,\ras shown in panel 3, the growth of potential in the current Tealbook (the red bars) is\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r26 of 219\r\rprojected to be noticeably slower than in last December’s Tealbook (the gray bars).\rAccordingly, the path for the real GDP gap (panel 4) is narrower than it was a year\rago, and we currently expect it to close in mid-2016, a little later than the\runemployment rate gap, reflecting the additional cyclical slack that we judge to be\rpresent in the labor force participation rate.\rAs shown in panel 5, an important negative influence on the GDP projection\rrelative to last December has been the sharply higher path over the past year for the\rreal exchange value of the dollar. In addition, a weaker outlook for foreign growth\r(not shown) also holds down our projection, while oil prices and equity prices have\rbecome more supportive. All told, with an unchanged projection for inflation (which\rI will discuss in a moment) and a little tighter resource utilization, one might expect\rthe path for the federal funds rate—shown in panel 6—to be higher than it was a year\rago. However, we also made a small reduction in our estimate of the equilibrium real\rinterest rate, which left our projection for the federal funds rate essentially unrevised.\rOur inflation projection is described in the next exhibit. As shown on line 3 of\rpanel 1, we expect core PCE prices to rise at an annual rate of 1½ percent this quarter.\rThis forecast is somewhat higher than in the October Tealbook, reflecting surprises in\rthe price data for October in some volatile categories, particularly the non-marketbased component of the index, from which we take little signal for near-term\rinflation. We expect core inflation to remain at 1½ percent in the first quarter,\runrevised from the October Tealbook. Overall PCE prices, line 1, are projected to be\rabout unchanged in the fourth quarter and to decline around ½ percent in the first\rquarter, reflecting the recent and expected declines in consumer energy prices. We\rwill provide you with an update to this forecast tomorrow morning after we receive\rthe consumer price index for November.\rAs shown by the blue lines in panel 2, crude oil prices have continued to move\rdown since the previous meeting. Consistent with readings from futures markets, we\rexpect the decline in crude oil prices to stop around the turn of the year and that oil\rprices will drift up gradually thereafter. The path for retail gasoline prices—the black\rlines—has revised in a similar fashion, but because of the usual lag between changes\rin oil and gasoline prices, we do not expect retail gasoline prices to stop declining\runtil sometime in the first quarter.\rRecent readings on inflation compensation and expectations, panel 3, have been\rmixed. The SPF measure of 10-year PCE price expectations (the blue dashed line)\rwas unchanged in the fourth quarter, and the preliminary reading on longer-term\rinflation expectations in December from the Michigan survey (the black line) moved\rback into the narrow range that has prevailed in recent years after an unusually low\rreading in November. TIPS-based inflation compensation 5-to-10 years ahead (the\rred line) has declined noticeably, although staff models suggest that much of the\rThe black lines in panels 4 and 5 give our medium-term projections for total and\rcore PCE price inflation, and the red dashed lines show our projections last\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r27 of 219\r\rover the past year apart from the recent energy-related drop in headline inflation. All\rtold, we expect core PCE inflation of 1.5 percent in 2015, 1.6 percent in 2016, and 1.8\rpercent in 2017. As energy prices stabilize, total PCE inflation moves back closer to\rcore inflation in the second quarter of 2015.\rPanel 6 summarizes recent indicators of labor compensation. These indicators\rhave been mixed recently but generally continue to point to gains over the past year\rin the vicinity of 2 percent. The employment cost index—the black line—last quarter\rposted its largest four-quarter change in several years, but the volatile measure of\rhourly compensation in the business sector—the blue line—was weaker than we had\rexpected last quarter. Finally, average hourly earnings—the red line—were, on net,\rabout as expected in October and November. On balance, we view the recent gains in\rcompensation as modest, and we continue to expect a gradual acceleration in labor\rcompensation over the next few years as the labor market tightens further. Chris\rErceg will now continue our presentation.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. As indicated in line 1 of the table in exhibit 5, foreign GDP growth\rappears to have been quite subdued in the second half of the year and well below\rwhat we were projecting at the time of your last chart show in June. We expect that\rforeign growth will pick up next year and remain just above 3 percent over the\rforecast period. This outlook is little changed from our projection six months ago.\rAlthough the underlying momentum of the foreign economy is weaker, several\rfactors—in part engendered by this weakness—should boost growth in the period\rahead: greater monetary policy stimulus, substantial currency depreciation—panel\r2—and the dramatic fall in oil prices since midsummer. These factors also have\rimportant consequences for the U.S. economy, as I will examine later in my briefing.\rA good deal of the current weakness and forecast uncertainty is centered in the\reuro area and Japan. Euro-area GDP, line 3, is currently rising at a less than 1 percent\rpace, consistent with the declines in PMIs shown in panel 3, and we have growth\rpicking up only gradually. Monetary policy stimulus measures announced this\ryear—including the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTRO, in June\rand the September commitment to employ asset purchases to expand the balance\rsheet to 2012 levels—have helped push down bond yields and the euro. Given the\rusual lags in monetary transmission, we project that the effects of these measures will\rbecome more apparent next year: We estimate that they will boost euro-area GDP\rgrowth by nearly ½ percentage point on average in 2015 and 2016, when the stimulus\rfrom a lower euro is factored in. This estimate assumes that the ECB will announce\radditional asset purchases in January amounting to 200 billion euros. The ECB is\rcurrently considering more-aggressive measures, but we have not yet built these into\rour baseline outlook. In addition to the stimulus from monetary easing and a weaker\rcurrency, we also see euro-area GDP as getting a significant boost from lower oil\rprices and waning fiscal and financial headwinds.\rJapan, line 4, will also be happy to celebrate the end of 2014. Although we\rexpect Japan to move out of recession in the fourth quarter, GDP is likely to have\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r28 of 219\r\rflatlined in the second half of the year. Due to the potent effect of the April VAT tax\rhike on domestic demand—consumption, panel 5, remains below its level prior to the\rstart of “Abenomics”—the second installment of the tax hike was deferred until the\rspring of 2017. Amid growing concern that the weak economy was undermining\rprogress in boosting inflation to 2 percent, the BOJ decided in late October to step up\rits pace of JGB purchases under its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing\rProgram, QQE—to about 16 percent of GDP at an annual rate, panel 6—and the\rgovernment pension fund simultaneously announced a large shift in its portfolio\rholdings toward domestic and foreign equity. We see GDP growth picking up next\ryear as the lower yen boosts exports and as increased monetary accommodation feeds\rthrough to domestic demand.\rTurning to your next exhibit, real GDP growth in the EMEs in the third and fourth\rquarters looks to be well below what we projected in June. The weakness is\rconcentrated in Latin America. GDP growth in Mexico, line 2, was a dismal\r2 percent in the third quarter, although most recent indicators—including\rmanufacturing PMIs, panel 2—suggest greater underlying strength, and we see\rgrowth recovering to nearly 3½ percent next year. By contrast, we are much less\roptimistic about Brazil. Brazil’s overly expansive policies following the global\rfinancial crisis have led to persistently high inflation, panel 3. With monetary and\rfiscal policy likely to be tight, Brazil’s growth prospects will depend on its ability to\rimplement structural reforms and rebuild confidence.\rSkipping halfway across the globe, real GDP growth in China, line 4 of the table,\rappears to have moderated a bit from its robust third-quarter pace. Falling property\rprices this year, panel 4, have contributed to some slowing in residential investment\rfrom its previous very rapid pace, and recent indicators suggest some deceleration in\rmanufacturing. Even so, China’s slowdown appears to be in line with what we have\rbeen expecting for some time, and retail sales, panel 5, remain reasonably strong. We\rexpect that policy stimulus—including increased lending to the banking sector by the\rPBOC as well as steps to support the property sector—will allow GDP growth to\rcontinue to top 7 percent. Of course, there are many downside risks, especially given\rthe weakness in property markets.\rWhile I have already indicated that we see lower oil prices as likely to boost\rgrowth in oil-importing economies, your next exhibit provides a closer look at how\rthe large fall in oil prices since June, panel 1, has affected the outlook. As best as we\rcan tell, most of the decline reflects favorable supply surprises, including to U.S. and\rLibyan oil production, and from OPEC’s decision to not curtail production. Even so,\rslow growth in the global economy has also played an important role.\rA fall in the price of oil affects net oil importers, such as the United States,\rthrough several channels (panel 2). First, by reducing transfers to oil exporters, a\rlower oil price effectively acts as a tax cut to oil-importing countries. Second, lower\roil prices raise potential output both through boosting oil usage in production and\rthrough capital deepening. Of course, for major energy producers such as the United\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r29 of 219\r\rStates, this effect will be partly offset by lower oil production. Third, lower oil prices\rreduce inflation. Finally, the output response depends on monetary policy.\rAlthough oil-importing economies should benefit from declining oil prices,\robservers have raised concerns that these declines may exacerbate disinflationary\rpressures and potentially even harm the economy. Such a risk seems particularly\rrelevant for the euro area and Japan. To explore this possibility, we used the staff’s\rgeneral-equilibrium, perfect-foresight SIGMA model to gauge the effect of a\r20 percent permanent decline in the oil price—caused by a favorable supply shock—\rfrom its current level. The responses we will report later for the United States differ\rsomewhat from those of the staff’s judgmental assessment, which is based on the\rFRB/US model.\rThe middle panels show the response of euro-area GDP growth, headline\rinflation, and the policy rate, while the bottom panels show the corresponding\rvariables for the United States. A key difference between the two economies is that\rour baseline assumes that liftoff of the policy rate occurs in the second quarter of\r2015 in the United States, but not until early 2018 in the euro area.\rIf inflation expectations are anchored, as we assume in our baseline projections,\rthe shock has fairly similar effects in the euro area and the United States. Real GDP\rgrowth in this scenario—the red dashed lines in panels 3a and 4a—rises persistently\rabove baseline—the solid black lines. Total inflation, panels 3b and 4b, falls because\rof the relatively direct effect of lower oil prices and because core inflation falls a little\ras the lower oil prices reduce cost pressures. Because inflation and output move in\ropposite directions, monetary policy is little affected in either economy.\rWe next consider the effects of the same 20 percent decline in oil prices in a\rscenario in which inflation expectations are not fully anchored and decline as actual\rinflation falls. The decline in inflation expectations has very adverse effects on the\reuro area. Given that the zero bound is expected to bind for a very long time even in\rthe baseline, real interest rates rise substantially and cause euro-area GDP growth to\rfall below baseline, the green line in panel 3a. By contrast, U.S. GDP in this case—\rthe green line in panel 4a—is very similar to when inflation expectations are\ranchored, reflecting that monetary policy, panel 4c, cushions the shock by simply\rlifting off more slowly. To sum up, the fall in oil prices this year is likely to be a net\rpositive for the global economy. However, for economies in which disinflation has\rbeen acute and the stability of inflation expectations is uncertain, lower oil prices\rpose some special challenges.\rYour next exhibit considers how the dollar’s sharp appreciation since June is\rexpected to affect the U.S. economy. Our forecast for the path of the dollar over the\rnext two years, panel 1, is about 7 percent higher than we projected in June. On the\rone hand, we expect the dollar to appreciate a bit further against the AFE currencies,\rpanel 2, as markets are surprised by a modestly faster removal of U.S. policy\raccommodation than they seem to envision. On the other hand, we continue to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r30 of 219\r\rproject that the dollar will depreciate against the EME currencies, panel 3, as the\rAsian economies, especially China, rebalance toward domestic demand.\rThe stronger path for the dollar and modest weakening of the outlook for foreign\rgrowth are likely to translate into much weaker U.S. export growth. We now expect\rexport growth, the blue bars in panel 4, to average only about 2 to 3 percent in 2015\rand 2016, about half the pace we projected in June (the red bars). Our forecast for\rimport growth is only a tad higher than in June, as the effects of the stronger dollar\rare partly counterbalanced by downward revisions to the U.S. outlook.\rAll told, as shown in panel 6, we estimate that real net exports will make a\rcontribution to U.S. GDP growth of about minus 0.4 percentage point in both 2015\rand 2016, in sharp contrast to the roughly neutral contribution we had expected in\rYour next exhibit examines the external sector of the U.S. economy during three\rprevious episodes of monetary tightening—those beginning in 1994, 1999, and 2004\r—and compares them with our forecast for 2015. The dashed vertical lines show the\rquarter in which a monetary policy tightening sequence began, while the shaded blue\rregions extend one year before and after this date.\rTwo interesting features are apparent from these episodes. First, the broad real\rdollar, panel 1, shows no tendency to rise during or shortly before past monetary\rtightenings and, in fact, depreciated substantially around the 2004 episode. Second,\rU.S. exports, panel 2, also grew robustly during each of these tightening episodes.\rThus, the dollar’s recent sharp appreciation appears a bit unusual and helps\raccount for our forecast of relatively weak export growth in this current episode—the\rfar-right shaded bar in panel 2. Even so, the positive gap between foreign and U.S.\rGDP growth over the forecast period, panel 3, provides some comfort for our forecast\rthat the dollar will not appreciate a good deal more. Moreover, the relatively modest\rgap between expected U.S. and foreign policy rates—panel 4—at least seems\rconsistent with limited upward pressure on the dollar.\rAll told, we do not see our projection for the dollar and U.S. external performance\ras being markedly at variance with the record of past Fed tightening. Export growth\ris likely to be noticeably weaker but still positive.\rNonetheless, turning to exhibit 6, overall foreign growth is considerably weaker\rthan in past monetary tightening, and there are serious downside risks in Europe,\rChina, and many other EMEs that—if they materialize—could weigh heavily on the\rdollar and the U.S. external sector. To judge the impact if these risks materialize and,\rthus, to conclude this briefing on a perky note, I revisit the SIGMA simulation that\rwas featured in the December Tealbook. The scenario assumes that total foreign\rGDP growth weakens by 1 percentage point over the forecast period per year, and\rthat the broad dollar appreciates 10 percent relative to its baseline path. Our scenario\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r31 of 219\r\rsuggests that such a weakening would push U.S. GDP growth well below 2 percent\rnext year and core inflation below 1 percent. I will now turn it over to Beth.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. KLEE. 4 Thank you. I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for\rBriefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”\rExhibit 1 shows the broad trajectories of your forecasts under your individual\rassessments of appropriate monetary policy. As shown in the top panel, you project\rslower growth this year than in 2013, and all but one of you see a pickup in GDP\rgrowth next year, with most of you anticipating real growth moving back toward its\rlonger-run pace over 2016 and 2017. Most of you project that the unemployment\rrate, shown in the second panel, will decline through 2016, and all of you project that,\rby the fourth quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate will be at or below your\rindividual judgments of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. The bottom\rtwo panels indicate that all of you see inflation rising gradually on balance over the\rforecast period, with only two of you expecting inflation above the Committee’s\r2 percent goal in 2017. Notably, your views on headline inflation in 2015 span a\rrange from 1 to 2.2 percent.\rExhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the September\rSummary of Economic Projections and the December Tealbook. As reflected in the\rtop panel, in general, the revisions to your forecasts for real GDP growth were\rmodest. Although all of you revised up your projections for the second half of this\ryear (not shown), the central tendencies of your projections for subsequent years were\ressentially unchanged. As shown in the second panel, the central tendencies of your\rforecasts for the unemployment rate shifted down by roughly two-tenths each year\rthrough 2016, with many of you noting that recent data regarding labor market\rconditions shaped your revisions. Notably, six of you lowered your projections for\rthe longer-run normal rate of unemployment, narrowing the range to 5.0 to\r5.8 percent, although the central tendency was unchanged at 5.2 to 5.5 percent. As\rthe bottom panels indicate, nearly all of you marked down your projections for\rheadline PCE inflation this year and next, although most of your projections for 2016\rand 2017 were little changed. A majority of you revised down a bit your projections\rfor near-term core inflation as well. Many of you pointed to the recent substantial\rThe Tealbook forecast for economic growth is generally near the bottom of your\rcentral tendencies over the projection period, and the staff’s projections for the\runemployment rate are about at the lower end of your central tendencies over the\rperiod. Similarly, for headline and core inflation, the Tealbook projections are\rgenerally near the bottom of your central tendencies throughout the projection period.\rExhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the year and quarter in\rwhich you currently judge that economic conditions will make it appropriate to\rincrease the target range for the federal funds rate and the economic conditions you\r4\r\rThe materials used by Ms. Klee are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r32 of 219\r\ranticipate at that time. As shown in the top panel, a substantial majority of you view\rthe first half of 2015 as the most likely time of liftoff, with five of you projecting\rliftoff in the first quarter and seven in the second quarter. Two of you anticipate that\rit will be appropriate to raise rates for the first time in 2016. The bottom panel plots\ryour views on the unemployment rate and core inflation in the quarter of liftoff.\r(Comparable scatterplots in previous briefings have employed headline inflation\rinstead of core, but given the large transitory effects on inflation from changes in\renergy prices, core inflation seems more useful in this case.) As shown in the plot,\ryour projections for the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff range mostly\rbetween 5.3 and 5.7 percent, while your core inflation projections are mostly\rclustered between 1½ and 1¾ percent. All but two of you project that the\runemployment rate at the time of liftoff will still be above its longer-run normal level,\rand all but one of you project that core inflation will be below the Committee’s\rlonger-run objective for headline inflation of 2 percent.\rExhibit 4 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path for\rthe federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the\rlonger run. The median assessment of the appropriate funds rate path now stands at\r1.13 percent at the end of 2015, 2.5 percent at the end of 2016, and 3.63 percent at the\rend of 2017. Eight of you revised down your view of the appropriate funds rate in\r2015 and 2016, with the median federal funds rate down 25 basis points in 2015 and\r38 basis points in 2016. Many of you noted that increases to the federal funds rate\rwould likely be gradual, and almost all currently anticipate that it will likely be\rappropriate to increase the target range at a pace no greater than 25 basis points per\rmeeting in the year of liftoff. A couple of you noted that the uncertain effects of rate\rincreases on financial markets suggested that a relatively slow pace of rate hikes\rwould be preferable. In addition, a few of you specifically noted that the inflation\routlook indicated that a slow pace of tightening would be appropriate.\rAll of you project levels of the federal funds rate over the next couple of years\rthat are below the prescriptions of a noninertial Taylor (1999) rule given your\reconomic projections. However, the revisions to your projections for the federal\rfunds rate over 2015 and 2016 are broadly consistent with those prescribed by that\rrule, especially if the rule uses core, rather than headline, inflation.\rAs shown in the final exhibit, your assessments of the uncertainty and risks\rsurrounding your economic projections have changed little since September. The top\rtwo panels in the column on the left show that nearly all of you judge the current\rlevel of uncertainty about real GDP growth and unemployment to be broadly similar\rto the average level of the past 20 years. A substantial majority of you also judge the\rlevel of uncertainty about inflation, shown in the lower two panels in the column on\rthe left, to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years. However, a\rcouple more of you now view uncertainty about headline inflation as higher than the\raverage level of the past 20 years than was the case in September.\rAs shown in the top two panels in the column on the right, most of you continue\rto see the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced;\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r33 of 219\r\roffsetting risks for real GDP growth include, on the upside, stronger fundamentals,\rand, on the downside, a weaker international outlook than currently embedded in your\rforecasts. As reported in third panel on the right, six of you now see risks to headline\rinflation as weighted to the downside, while only one of you sees inflation risks as\rweighted to the upside; declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar were\rnoted as factors that could place greater downward pressure on prices than currently\rin your forecasts. Thank you, Madam Chair. This concludes the staff presentations.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you very much. The floor is open for questions to any of our\rbriefers. Vice Chairman.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I have a question and I have an observation. The\rquestion concerns the core PCE forecast on exhibit 4. Since October we’ve seen a stronger\rdollar, weaker oil prices, and probably a slightly weaker foreign economic outlook, yet our core\rinflation forecasts are actually higher now than they were then. I’m not saying that I disagree\rwith the current forecast, but how do you reconcile the evolution of the forecast of core inflation\rwith the developments of the stronger dollar and weaker oil prices? I just want to understand the\rstaff thinking on this, and then I want to make an observation or suggestion to the staff.\rThere’s very good stuff on oil prices here, but I’d be very interested now in seeing the\rconsequences of the fall in oil prices in terms of international capital flows, demand for U.S.\rTreasuries, and foreign exchange reserve accumulation. Another consequence of this is going to\rbe a big effect on current account balances around the world and potentially the demand for U.S.\rTreasury securities. So I think it would be nice, at some future meeting, not only to take the real\rconsequences of oil prices, but also to translate them into a financial dimension.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KAMIN. We’ve been focusing both on the real implications and on the financialstability implications. You’ve brought up yet another set of issues that we also would be very\rinterested in working on.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Think about the Treasury market. We’ve had very\rstrong demand for Treasury securities from us through the LSAP program and very strong\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r34 of 219\r\rdemand for Treasury securities from oil-producing countries in terms of their accumulation of\rforeign exchange reserves, and we’re sort of losing both of those.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KAMIN. Yes, I think we believe that the net effect is certainly going to be to\rreduce external imbalances—smaller deficits for us, smaller surpluses for oil producers.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. And is that a good thing? Is that the end of the saving\rglut? There are a lot of interesting questions, I think, embedded.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STEVENS. On your question about core inflation—over the medium term, we do\rhave some upward pressure on prices from the unemployment rate path being marked down, and\rso that’s offsetting some of what we’re seeing on the exchange rate, oil prices, and some of these\rother factors. In the end, it’s a wash for core prices. We do end up with a lower rate in 2015 for\rtotal PCE price inflation because of the weaker energy prices, of course, but the main factor in\rthere for core, I think, is really the markdown in the unemployment-rate path.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. President Evans.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Thank you, Madam Chair. On page 4, exhibit 3, you talk about inflation\rcompensation, and a chart that we’ve all seen is the TIPS five-year, five-year-forward, which is\rthe decline is term and liquidity premiums. My question is, if it were to stabilize at this level\rthrough June, would we still be thinking it’s term and liquidity premiums—I don’t know what\rthe short- and medium-run properties of these objects are likely to be—are there any refutable\rimplications here from saying it’s inflation expectations or I think it ought to go away?\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r35 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. I don’t think there’s an immediate sense that those are factors that\rshould reverse themselves in short order, if that’s your question, that we shouldn’t necessarily\rexpect these term and liquidity premiums to move.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. These are durable explanations.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. I think my intuition, like yours, is that if it were just a decline in the\ractual and expected inflation that was permanent, that should ultimately show up in the model,\rand so in that sense you’d see a shift from the term premiums and liquidity premiums to\rexpected inflation coming out of the models. But I don’t think that’s something that I\rnecessarily would expect to see in the next few months.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. So we’re looking for a pretty bright economic outlook next year, and the\rinternational situation seems to be relatively optimistic compared with other things you might\rwrite down. That’s not likely to also have implications for the term premiums or the liquidity\rpremiums?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. It certainly could, but what we’ve tried to do in the Tealbook kind of\rregression exercise is, looking at the term premiums or other premiums in this model, what are\rthey functions of? You get something out of volatility. You get something out of some\rparticular market factors in these markets, but they’re hard to explain, I think. What the model is\rtelling us is that there are specific factors in the TIPS market and the nominals market that are\rmoving around the TIPS-based inflation compensation independent of movements in inflation\rexpectations, and I think that could be true for a while depending on how durable those factors\rare that are moving around the numbers in the TIPS yields.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r36 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. I think it would be good to get more direct evidence on that. Some of the\rdirect measures we have of the swap basis and nominal versus real asset swaps haven’t changed\rthat much. So it’s harder to do it if it lasts for one year, say.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Let me take one more crack at this. If there are really no identifiable\rdifferences across these three objects—inflation expectations, term premiums, or liquidity\rpremiums—I don’t know how much confidence I have in any of the explanations. I mean,\ridentification from some additional series that we’re looking at ought to provide some\rinformation. I’m sympathetic to what Simon was saying—it’s another way of saying that, I\rguess.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. But the models are pretty consistent right now. It’s just that none of us\rhave 100 percent confidence in any model.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. I think that’s right, but to the point you were making, President Evans,\rthe models are using, in the case of the Board model, nominal and real yields and survey\rmeasures of inflation expectations, and a no-arbitrage yield curve model to try to pick these\rthings apart, and this is where the models end up.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Yes, it’s just that usually there are differential time-series implications\rfrom them that you can draw out. Now, I understand the uncertainty and how much confidence\ryou have around those estimates, but that’s fine. I’ll give up on that.\rIf I could ask one more question, the international outlook seems to be maybe a little\rbetter than I might have expected. Now, the imponderable question: How important is the ECB\rfollow-through on their balance sheet expansion for the way we’re viewing Europe and the rest\rof the world? What if they don’t get there? Any commentary along those lines would be\rhelpful.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r37 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. Sure. We think that their commitment to reflating the balance sheet back\rto 2012 levels played a substantial role in reducing term premiums and risk spreads—so those\rcame down for periphery relative to core economies—and, finally, in the substantial depreciation\rof the euro. All those forces are an important part of our assumption that growth will pick up to\ran admittedly not very torrid pace next year.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. No, I understand.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. But those are quite important. In terms of follow-through, we think that it\ris very important. They laid down a commitment in September, and markets are expecting them\rto deliver at least that, if not more.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. President Kocherlakota.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a comment on the\rline of questioning that President Evans had about the term premiums and liquidity premiums.\rMy intuition is that if you looked at the zero-coupon inflation swaps as opposed to TIPS\rbreakevens, you should typically not see as much liquidity movements in those zero-coupon\rinflation swaps. But the relative liquidity effects on TIPS versus Treasuries are much more\rpronounced than on the different sides of a zero-coupon inflation swap position. So that should\rhelp on the liquidity part. On the risk premium part, I think that as the memo from the\rMinneapolis Fed indicated, those are reflective, in our view, of actual fundamentals. And so\rthere is no reason to see those unwind relatively rapidly.\rI had a question about the exercise in SIGMA on exhibit 7. I am puzzling over this, and I\rcan’t quite figure it out. If you go to the U.S. case, number 4, “Effects of a 20% Fall in Oil\rPrices on U.S. Economy in SIGMA,” it seems in the unanchored case that inflation runs\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r38 of 219\r\rnoticeably below what happens in the anchored case, which is what you’d expect, but it doesn’t\rseem to have material growth consequences. I would have thought that in this “perfect\rforesight” model, that would affect the real interest rate, and, therefore, have an effect on growth.\rBut obviously I’m wrong, so—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. I think it’s helpful to think about it abstracting from the zero bound. If an\reconomy faces an unwanted fall in long-run inflation expectations, then the central bank would\rtake aggressive actions, lowering real interest rates, to undo that. And, at least in the prism of\rour models, that would actually be stimulative. So you lower long-term interest rates across the\rmaturity spectrum for some time, and that would be stimulative.\rIt is kind of the flip side of what happened in the 1970s, when long-term inflation\rexpectations became unanchored. Then we eventually had to raise real interest rates and cause\rthe economy to contract. So what happens with the zero bound is, it matters crucially how long\rthe constraint lasts and how big the shock is. Those are two key factors.\rThe shock we’re considering is pretty modest in size, but big enough that you can see it.\rI think long-term inflation expectations come down ¼ percentage point, and that’s more than\rwhat you would think would occur in response to a fall in oil prices, most likely. But still, we\rwanted it to show up.\rBut the key thing is that, in the U.S. case, with the zero-bound constraint and relatively\rsmall shocks, you get lower inflation in the very short term, so that raises the very near-term real\rinterest rate. But then you lower the whole path of interest rates thereafter because you raise\rrates more gradually, and that lowers real long rates going out for quite a long time. And so it\rbecomes balanced—practically zero in our simulation. Conversely, in the ECB’s case, they’re\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r39 of 219\r\rconstrained for a long time, real interest rates go up for several years, and then the economy\rreally gets walloped.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. All right. Thanks a lot. So you’re basically just offsetting the\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. That’s right.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Okay. Thanks.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. President Kocherlakota, if I can turn back just for a moment to the\rinflation swaps versus TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation, the Cleveland Fed has a\rmodel that uses inflation swaps to extract long-term expected inflation and inflation risk\rpremiums. That model shows broadly similar results in the sense that it also shows 10-year\rexpected inflation hasn’t declined a lot, at least based on their decomposition.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes. I’m not as familiar with that model as I should be.\rthat you get out of the zero-coupon inflation swaps, you see that expected inflation has fallen, but\rnot as much as what you get off breakevens.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. So it’s chart 7. But what you’d usually expect is that there would be\rsome disconnect between the fall in the swap-implied measure and the TIPS-implied measure,\rthe cash market. We’re not seeing a large movement there. That doesn’t mean that it isn’t the\rliquidity features, because if you talk to the swap traders, a lot of how they price this is what has\rhappened in the cash market. So we want to be a little bit careful—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. That’s absolutely fair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POTTER. Thanks.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. President Bullard.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r40 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a question on exhibit 2, panel 6,\rwhich is on the near-term outlook for real GDP. So Q3 in the October Tealbook was 2.7 percent\rat an annual rate, and Q3 currently is 4.6 percent. My question is, is that much of a difference\rconsistent with historical norms in these kinds of revisions? Or would you say that that’s an\routsized surprise to the upside?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STEVENS. I think this is on the larger side, so a big part of this—that last\r½ percentage point since the December Tealbook—is the Quarterly Services Survey, which, this\rentire year, has been surprising us in different directions. We got a larger-than-expected reading\ron federal defense spending. That was a bit anomalous for some seasonal adjustment reasons, so\rwe had some surprising readings. I think it’s more useful to take a look at, as on line 4 there,\rdomestic final purchases. That revision is much smaller since the October Tealbook. I wouldn’t\rpay as much attention to the revision on GDP.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Okay. And I have another question, also on oil prices, exhibit 7. In\rparts 3 and 4, we’re comparing euro-area GDP and U.S. GDP in the aftermath of a 20 percent\rfall in oil prices. I thought the conventional wisdom was that Europe is less sensitive to oil price\rmovements because they have higher taxes on oil prices, so that the percent change in actual\rgasoline prices and so on is smaller. There might be other effects as well, so that Europe was\rless sensitive. But I’m looking at these two GDP pictures. They look like they’re the same. So\rwhat’s the story there?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. It’s certainly true for headline inflation that, because oil is heavily taxed,\rthe share of energy in the overall consumption basket is somewhat smaller, and so you see\rsmaller declines in headline inflation when comparing 3b and 4b. But for output, essentially we\rhave the view that transfers are much larger, basically in the case of an oil price decline like\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r41 of 219\r\rwe’re considering, and they benefit the euro area much more because they don’t produce any of\rtheir own oil.\rEssentially their net oil imports are something like 3 percent of GDP, whereas in the\rUnited States it is now much smaller. A few years ago, that would have been the case. But now\rwe’ve become a major producer, and so our net oil import bill is on the order of 1½ percent of\rGDP. The transfer effect is much larger in the euro area, and it kind of acts as a stimulus to\raggregate demand. They get more money in their pocket, and they spend it. So you get a more\rfront-loaded impact in consumption in the euro area. It’s not hugely larger, because there are\rother factors at play, but it shows up in the simulation.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Okay. And just a follow-up to that, for Europe you have the\runanchored case leading to slower GDP growth in 2016. I know you said something about this,\rbut I want to hear more about why that is, because that doesn’t occur in the U.S. case, according\rto this.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. That’s right. In the unanchored case in Europe, the decline in inflation\rexpectations pushes up real interest rates going out for several years. And that has a pretty\rcontractionary effect on the economy, whereas in the U.S. case, we are just constrained by the\rzero bound in this baseline for a couple of quarters. There is a very near-term effect of pushing\rdownward the real interest rate, but going further out, we can simply allow the path of interest\rrates to run up more slowly, so the net effect on the real interest rate is going to be essentially\rzero. You see very little difference.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. So what about QE in Europe? You would think that there would be a\rsubstantial monetary policy response.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r42 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. That’s right, exactly. Because you get the fall in term premiums, and you\rdon’t get the offsetting adjustments in the policy rate that would damp that effect.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KAMIN. President Bullard, to that question, implicit in these scenarios is that the\rcentral bank is just using policy interest rates, so that if you thought that unconventional\rmonetary policy or QE was entirely interchangeable with the conventional policy of altering the\rpolicy rate—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Which it clearly is.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KAMIN: —well, which it clearly is, so then the scenario doesn’t quite work. But\robviously the use of QE is a little bit more uncertain, both in the United States and particularly\rabroad, than the use of policy rates. That is clearly an attitude that is shared by the ECB itself,\rwhich is actively considering QE, but will be dragged into it with some members less happy\rabout it than others.\rIn some sense, one response to this scenario, if you were on the ECB board, might be to\rsay, “Okay. Well, we don’t want to get into that situation, so why don’t we use more\runconventional monetary policy stimulus so that we could lift off our policy rate earlier, so that\rwe could buy the policy flexibility that the United States has?”\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Lockhart.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. LOCKHART. I’d like to continue on the subject of Europe. Starting with exhibit\r10, the point to me of that exhibit is, if we have weaker foreign growth than we expect in our\rbaseline, it could have a pretty significant effect on some of the assumptions we have as we get\rtoward liftoff. And your picture of Europe is reasonably sanguine, it strikes me, in the fairly near\rterm. And that is a combination of extraordinary monetary policy and lower oil prices.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r43 of 219\r\rThe question I have on the oil price effect is that they are buying oil in dollars, but they\rrun their economy in euros. You would have to combine the exchange rate effect with the oil\rprice in dollars to get the true cost effect to their economy, the benefit to their economy. Have\ryou calculated that?\rAnd then, in the relative near term—this is a guess—a good part of their oil supplies\rwould be under contract, which would have been contracts set before the decline in oil prices.\rSo there would be a lag before their dollar price of oil actually is as cheap as we perceive it in\rdollar terms. Have you calculated that? And if you have done all of that, then how are you as\rsanguine as you are in the near term about the European economy?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KAMIN. Sort of leading the witness. [Laughter]\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. I’m not sure I would want to characterize our forecast as “sanguine.” I\rthink our growth outlook goes up from a very low level, so we essentially have euro-area GDP\rthis year likely to come in at a snail’s pace of below 1 percent, rising to about 1½ percent next\ryear. Oil does play a material role in that, although there are many factors that we think provide\ra boost. The monetary easing and the exchange rate depreciation really provide the lion’s share\rin just getting you up there to 1½ percent from 1 percent. That’s roughly ½ percentage point\rright there. We think that fiscal pressures, which were very much toward consolidation until the\rlast year or two, are going to also contribute favorably to growth and give you probably another\rcouple of tenths.\rNow, on the oil side, we do calculate the euro area price, and we feed that in. I think that\rthat has moved a little over 20 percent since June. Steve looks like he has the chart—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KAMIN. We have our little parsing table that suggests, looking at movements since\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r44 of 219\r\rsense, mute the effect of the decline in oil prices in local currency, that the fall in oil prices will,\rover the next couple of years, boost euro-area GDP by around ⅓ percentage point, and the\rdepreciation of their currency against the dollar maybe another tenth. So, all told, that rounds up\rto what Chris mentioned, which is about ½ percentage point of additional stimulus over the next\rcouple of years coming from oil and the exchange rate.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ERCEG. And we think that, given that this is quite persistent, the fact that there\rmight be lags in transmission to prices probably wouldn’t have too big of an effect, though we\rstill get in the ballpark of the assessments that Steve mentioned.\rI think it is also worth adding that we do perceive, as does the ECB, a lot of downside\rrisk to this forecast. It’s possible that even favorable developments could go badly, as we\rillustrated in the alternative scenario, and that very low wage growth coming in at well below 2\rpercent could interact with low oil prices and really help bring down inflation. There are a lot of\rrisks. It’s an environment in which most of the ECB participants in their Survey of Professional\rForecasters are projecting that the unemployment rate will be in double digits, basically over 50\rpercent of the forecasters four years ahead, and something like 40 percent of them five years\rahead. So there’s a lot of risk in the period ahead.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Okay. Any further questions?

President\rLacker is going to start us off.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. LACKER. Thank you, Madam Chair. For this meeting, I have again written down\ra somewhat restrained projection with real GDP growth of around 2¼ percent for the next couple\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r45 of 219\r\rof years. That rate is in line with the average rate we have seen over the past several years since\rthe recession. We have seen short spurts of stronger growth from time to time, like the one we\rare seeing this year, but these have been followed by periods of slower growth that bring down\rthe medium-term average growth rate.\rThat pattern has left me generally very hesitant to project that a surge in growth that we\rsee is going to be sustained in general. Indeed, over the course of the past year or so, the\rmagnitude of the acceleration in growth we’ve seen has been tempered in both the Tealbook and\rthe SEP. The last few months of data are starting to shift my thinking significantly, however.\rSome recent developments that were largely absent during previous growth spurts have led me to\rbelieve that the probability of a sustained increase in growth has risen.\rAt the previous meeting, we recognized the substantial improvements that we had seen in\rlabor markets, and the staff described those nicely this afternoon. The most recent numbers\rshow continued improvement. The November employment report brought average monthly\rpayroll employment gains over the past 12 months to 228,000, a notable increase over the pace\rshown in the previous years.\rThe behavior in the JOLTS data this year, I think, is particularly striking. We’ve seen a\rsubstantial increase in job openings this year, a 20 percent gain year-over-year, and hiring has\rincreased significantly as well. Moreover, quits are up 20 percent year-over-year, suggesting\rthat workers are becoming more confident in their job prospects.\rThe fact that these flow indicators seem to have broken away from the path that has\rcharacterized their behavior since the recession is significant, I think. At various points in this\rexpansion, some of us—Governor Tarullo, for example—have noted that measures of labor\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r46 of 219\r\rcontext, the JOLTS data may be signaling something more fundamental by way of improvement\rin activity ahead.\rThe continuing improvement in labor market conditions has also been reflected in the\runemployment rate, which has declined by 1.2 percentage points over the past year, faster than\rmany of us expected and faster than in previous years. This decline has been accompanied by\rsubstantial changes in labor force participation and an unusually high rate of workers reporting\rthat they are working part time for economic reasons, two factors the staff singled out in their\rpresentation.\rGiven these conditions, there has been an ongoing debate about whether the narrowly\rdefined unemployment rate U-3 continues to be an accurate measure of labor resource\rutilization. For example, relative to broader measures of unemployment, such as U-6, the current\rU-3 appears to be significantly below the rate that would be expected based on the relationship\rbetween U-3 and U-6 prior to 2007.\rAt past meetings, I have reported on the work of Richmond Fed economists on other\rmeasures of labor underutilization that are both broader and take a more differentiated view of\rthe labor market and labor market attachment than does U-6. These so-called nonemployment\rindexes weight individuals by their relative propensities to flow into employment. In contrast,\rmeasures like U-3 or U-6 give everyone without a full-time job a weight of either zero or one. It\rturns out that, based on the relationship between these nonemployment indexes and U-3 prior to\r2007, U-3 is now right in line with what we would expect. So this analysis says that the signal\rwe are getting from the standard unemployment rate neither understates nor overstates the\rimprovement in labor markets.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r47 of 219\r\rOne recurring motif in our discussions about labor market conditions this year has been\rthe idea that the labor market can’t be back to normal if we haven’t yet seen a significant\racceleration in wage rates. I’m not sure whether this is a reasonable hypothesis or not, but I do\rknow that wages and unemployment are not tightly correlated in the data. And, moreover, wage\racceleration typically lags rather than leads price acceleration. So the lack of apparent wage\racceleration—apart from the last couple of quarters for the ECI—does not, in my view, provide\rmuch information regarding the degree of slack in the labor market.\rA strengthening labor market could help bring about a more persistent increase in\rconsumption, and consumption growth in particular. In the past, I have been doubtful about\rprospects for a sustained increase in consumer spending growth because I felt we lacked\revidence of more optimistic household expectations regarding job market prospects that I\rthought were fundamental to an acceleration in spending growth. But I think that evidence is\rstarting to emerge. Both of the consumer confidence indexes have registered significant gains in\rrecent months. Drilling down into the Michigan survey, readings on current economic\rconditions, expected economic conditions 12 months ahead, and expected income growth have\rall shown sizable gains in the last few months. One should generally be skeptical about blips in\rthese consumer survey measures because they typically don’t improve consumer spending\rforecasts by much, conditioning on other variables. But these recent moves are striking, and they\rare well aligned with what is going on in labor market data. So I take them as confirming signals\rthat a meaningful pickup in the consumption growth trend could be ahead.\rA third area that suggests upside potential, to me, is manufacturing. The ISM and most\rof the regional diffusion indexes have been elevated in recent months. Manufacturing\remployment growth has been significantly more rapid this year than last. Monday’s industrial\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r48 of 219\r\rproduction report showed especially robust growth in manufacturing production in November,\rand it was across a broad array of industries as well. And investment in equipment and\rintangibles was strong in the past two quarters.\rLast month we heard an interesting report from a longtime contact of ours at the\rAssociation for Manufacturing Technology. He said that the association’s annual trade show this\rfall saw record attendance, which resulted in double the usual volume of orders. He described\rthe growth in orders as driven by some dramatic improvements in technology that were on\rdisplay at the show. He cited equipment that incorporates multiple functions—additive,\rsubtractive, and bending—that used to require separate machines to be performed. His\rassociation is forecasting continued growth in orders, on the order of 5 to 10 percent, attributable\rto strength in automotive, aerospace, and industrial sectors. Taken together, these developments\rsuggest to me that this growth spurt is more likely to be sustained than previous growth spurts.\rTurning now to inflation, the persistence of inflation around 1½ percent has had people\rworried about our 2 percent inflation goal. The huge relative price shock from the decline in oil\rprices and the dollar’s appreciation are going to make it difficult to discern changes in longerterm inflation trends from incoming data on inflation over the next several months. However,\rthe decline in gasoline prices can’t go on forever. What we’re facing in the coming months is\rjust a transitory dip in headline inflation. We can look through that to the core indexes to assess\rinflation trends, but big energy price moves tend to bleed through to core indexes to some extent\ras well, with a lag of a couple of months. So the core indexes might be cloudy, too. Thus, I’d\ravoid putting too much weight on incoming inflation data for the next few months. But I don’t\rthink that means policy should be on hold until energy price changes settle down.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r49 of 219\r\rSurvey measures of inflation expectations have been stable. TIPS spreads have declined\rbut are still near levels associated with the last several years of trading. So I still believe we have\rgood reason to be reasonably confident that inflation will trend back toward our 2 percent goal.\rThank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Fisher.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Thank you, Madam Chair. Building on what President Lacker discussed,\rI believe that highly-accommodative monetary policy, improved household finances, reduced\rfiscal drag, and tame non-oil commodity prices as well as oil prices have resulted in strong\rgrowth and an improving labor market.\rWage growth has gradually increased and is likely to rise at an increasing rate with\rfurther reductions in unemployment. And as I have mentioned before, we are seeing a little\rlaboratory in my Federal Reserve District of some 27 million people, in which unemployment is\rnow 5.1 percent and wage-price inflation is running at 3.7 percent, the highest since 2008.\rI was interested in exhibit 1, panel 6, and also in John’s presentation, exhibit 4, panel 6,\rwith regard to the different Federal Reserve Banks’ surveys of who is going to be raising pay, et\rcetera. I would suggest that we certainly have an issue of pay and total compensation and\rinflation in the highly skilled areas. If you look at Mercer data, for example, that is where they\rtypically concentrate. If you broaden out and talk to people, such as Manpower, their CEO, and\rso on, they do note that it may not be quite as aggressive at the lower income levels, but you are\rbeginning to see about a 1 percent rate of wage-price inflation on the shop floor.\rLooking ahead, from my perspective, faster wage gains and lower consumer energy\rprices will boost real household incomes and spending, contributing to a cycle of rising demand\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r50 of 219\r\rand employment. So I think we’re in a good dynamic here, and I believe that was the point that\ryou were making, President Lacker.\rMy projection for the real economy isn’t very different from the Tealbook baseline\rforecast, as updated December 11. And for those that are “dot-ologists,” I am number 15. I\rwon’t say much more than that. I have GDP growing slightly more rapidly in 2015 than does the\rTealbook and slightly less rapidly in 2016. Consistent with that pattern of output growth, I have\rthe unemployment rate drop a little further next year than shown in the Tealbook and have it\rhold steady in 2016. But we end up pretty much in the same place.\rI have revised my estimate of the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate downward a\rfew tenths based partly on the good work done at the Chicago Fed by Dan Sullivan, which\rcarefully controls for changes in the demographic composition of the population as well as its\reducation and skills attainment. I thought that was quite good work. My natural rate estimate is\rnow roughly equal to that of the Tealbook. My inflation projection is quite different from that of\rthe Tealbook, and I noted on panel 5 in the presentation made by Simon, the Board’s five-year,\rfive-year-forward inflation compensation reminded me of the old joke about the dyslexic\ragnostic that doesn’t believe in dog. You’ll get that in just a second. I may be transposing\rthings here, or I may just be too agnostic, but—you got it. Good. Williams, way to go.\r[Laughter] I continue to believe that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a rate\rconsistent with our inflation objective.\rI note that since we last met—and this was mentioned in one of the presentations—the\r5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey are up slightly,\rabout 10 basis points. The New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations’ median threeyear-ahead inflation is up 1 basis point. The Philly Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters’\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r51 of 219\r\rmedian 10-year inflation expectation is unchanged. And according to a note I read by Morgan\rStanley, the implied risk of deflation from the options market is 1 percent. That’s unchanged\rover the last six months. So I’m convinced in the near term that inflation responds to changes in\rslack, as well as levels of slack, and I’d prefer to use the trimmed mean as my measure of core\rinflation rather than strip out food and energy prices. And for all those reasons, I see inflation\rrising on a pretty consistent pace toward our 2 percent objective.\rI also continue to believe that increases in the unemployment rate are difficult to contain\ronce they begin, so the risks of misestimating slack are asymmetric. I have talked about this\rbefore. I consider it substantially more risky to overestimate slack than to underestimate it. But\rbecause I anticipate a higher inflation path than does the Tealbook, and because I see both\rsubstantially less benefit from overshooting full employment and substantially greater risk, I\rbelieve it’s appropriate for monetary policy to move quite a bit more rapidly to a neutral policy\rstance than is called for in the Tealbook baseline forecast.\rIn setting policy, I maintain that progress toward full employment is best gauged using\rthe unemployment rate. We have talked about that before. I did note that of the 14 alternative\rindicators of slack examined in the Board staff memo distributed prior to this meeting, 11 had a\rstrong pre-financial-crisis link to the unemployment rate. Of these 11 indicators, 10 now show\rless comparative slack than does the unemployment rate. The sole exception is the involuntary\rpart-time employment gap. Additionally, the unemployment rate remains a reliable guide, in my\rview, to wage and salary growth as measured by the employment cost index.\rMy view, Madam Chair, is that progress toward price stability is best measured by recent\rhistory and the near-term trajectory of the core inflation measures, such as the Dallas Fed’s\rtrimmed mean PCE inflation gauge. Fluctuations in headline inflation in response to supply-side\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r52 of 219\r\rshocks are inevitable, and indeed, I would argue, desirable. They can be persistent. After all,\reven a fair coin will sometimes come up heads eight times in a row. Low headline inflation that\ris supply-driven should not be a concern as long as nominal demand is projected to remain on a\rtrack consistent over the long term with our 2 percent inflation objective. And I believe that’s\rwhere we are.\rThe Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE inflation has averaged 1.65 percent over the past\ryear. It has been very steady for the past seven months. Our forecasting model suggests that it\rwill rise to just shy of 2 percent in 2015. So if we haven’t quite yet achieved our intermediateterm target, as we define price stability, I think we are getting pretty close.\rI also note that in table 2 of the appendix of the SEP and exhibit 3, which was\rsummarized when we went through the projections of the SEP, five individuals sitting at this\rtable feel liftoff should occur in the first quarter of 2015, while another seven feel it should occur\rin the second quarter of 2015. So the dots tell us—or tell me, at least—that the time frame for\rliftoff has shifted forward.\rWith regard to my interlocutors in the corporate sector—and I want to touch particularly\ron the subject of oil because Bill has twice, at the previous meeting and at this meeting, really\rdrilled down—no pun intended—on that subject matter. The net effect, except for the marginal\roil operators, is viewed as very positive. Obviously, if you’re in the transportation business,\ryou’re happy. The airlines are seeing this drop directly to the bottom line.\rMy favorite retailer to look at, other than the largest one in the United States, would have\rto be 7-Eleven, because they’re a huge retailer of gas, as well as a seller of snacks and beer and\rcigarettes to construction workers. Their average demography is about $48,500 in terms of\rincome level. It’s the second and third income quartile. Their same-store sales are running at\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r53 of 219\r\r4½ percent November over November. That’s up from 3.5 percent year-to-date before energy\rprices or gasoline prices at the pump began to come down, and that is versus 1.7 percent for last\ryear. And yet they still are massive retailers of gasoline. So that’s net of that figure.\rAnd then, the manufacturers I talk to in various sectors are also quite happy. I’ll give you\ran example, with permission from the CEO. A complex product line that uses a great deal of\rpetroleum input and pulp input—Kimberly-Clark—had budgeted 40 cents per share of inflation\rcosts due to energy. They just redid their budget, and now they expect to have 40 cents per share\rsavings by virtue of the decline in oil prices.\rI would say from the telecoms that I speak to, it does confirm very much what we have\rheard in terms of the most recent numbers for capacity utilization and cap-ex. What they in the\rtelecom business call “large enterprise investing” has been increasing for the last few months,\rand it was quite fallow for many months before. And, finally, I would say that the National\rFederation of Independent Business is also indicating much more active interest in terms of their\rfuture capital commitments and hiring plans.\rVice Chairman Dudley may remember that the last time we talked, we had a long\rconversation. You asked me where energy prices might go, and I mentioned that the expectation\rwas that the price of oil would dip down to $70 or below, according to practitioners in the\rbusiness, and that it was likely to stay in the $70 to $80 range for a prolonged period of up to\rtwo years, but we might have dips down further. So I’ve gone back to the same group. The\rprice basket of OPEC oil crude dipped to just a fraction below $60 yesterday—that is the\rreference point. Brent was $61.06. So with that, I asked whether or not this would have a\rsignificant effect on cap-ex.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r54 of 219\r\rWhat’s interesting in my District is I have 900 of the 1,900 operating wells in the\rcountry. We have actually seen permits surge since October; we still are at 900 operating wells,\rbut permits have increased. Remember, prices began to come down in June. So the expectation\ris that cap-ex adjustment will take place, but it will be less than people expect—the budgets have\ralready been set over the next year—and could have an effect of about 5 percent, in answer to\rthe question you asked me at the October meeting.\rThe real issue here is that the Saudis are basically engaging in an exercise of price\rdiscovery, and they just didn’t take seriously, nor did their colleagues—particularly the Kuwaitis\rand the Emirati—that this was a real development that would be lasting. They now believe it\rwill be, and they want to test the market to see how far it will go. And, by the way, I know that\rKing Abdullah rather enjoys poking it to the Iranians in the process. But this is really a pricediscovery exercise. No one I talked to in the business believes this will be a sharp V-shape,\rwhich may mean that they are completely wrong. Instead they claim—particularly the big ones\rthat operate in Saudi Arabia and know the Saudis well—that these prices are likely to be staying\rvery low, $70 to $80, maybe in the mid-$60s, for a period that could last up to two years. I\rwanted to give you a little more background on that.\rThe other thing I would conclude with, Madam Chair—if you remember at the previous\rmeeting, there was some concern that we would be signaling by the language that we added to\rthe statement that we were becoming a little bit more hawkish or less dovish. I do note that\racross the yield curve, rates really have not backed up at all. The two-year is up 6 basis points,\reverything else is down 6 to 30 basis points, depending on how far out you go. I also note that\rthe 15-year fixed mortgage rate is actually down, even though the 30-year mortgage rate is up 4\rbasis points. So there is not much change.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r55 of 219\r\rAs I mentioned before, the real angst in the marketplace right now is in the junk bond\rexpectation is that they will fail or have problems, as will their suppliers. And then the big ones\rwill come pick them up at cheap prices, those that actually have real properties that they should\rexploit.\rSo I would say in summary, Madam Chair, that the data continue to indicate that the\reconomy is improving. I believe they indicate that it’s improving at a faster pace than we had\rpreviously assumed. I’m in accord with President Lacker on that front, although I didn’t get as\rpessimistic as he did. And I believe that the net effect of these lower energy prices is a huge\rboost in a society that is 70 percent consumption driven and 70 percent service driven. Thank\ryou, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Rosengren.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Madam Chair. As we began expanding our balance\rsheet in 2008 and 2009, one of the biggest concerns raised was that such a policy would be\rinflationary. Yet six years later, one of the major problems confronting the economy remains an\rinflation rate that is too low, and this even at a time when the unemployment rate is approaching\rsome estimates of the natural rate.\rIn fact, if one focused on the consistently strong payroll employment growth over the\rpast six months, the unemployment rate at 5.8 percent, and the forecast of real GDP growth in\rexcess of potential growth, one might feel policy should lift off relatively soon. However, such\ran analysis would ignore the critical facts that current wage and price growth are significantly\rbelow levels consistent with our announced 2 percent inflation target. Moreover, my own\rforecast does not have us reaching a core PCE inflation rate of 2 percent any time soon.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r56 of 219\r\rOne possible explanation for the weakness in wages and prices is that labor markets have\rmore slack than a cursory assessment would indicate. Because of the disruptions that occurred\rduring the recession, it is quite possible that a U-3 unemployment rate, by itself, underestimates\rthe amount of labor market slack. With U-6 and long-term unemployment still elevated,\rdefining full employment with U-3 historical estimates may be why we are still seeing unusually\rlow wage and price inflation, even as U-3 approaches a value that many deem to be consistent\rwith full employment.\rAnother possibility is that the U-3 rate consistent with full employment is lower than our\rcurrent estimates. My own estimate of full employment is 5¼ percent. Before the recession, my\restimate was a shade under 5 percent. If the past 40 years have taught us anything, it is that the\rnatural rate moves around. Even relative to 2007, the labor force has become older and more\reducated. Older and more educated workers tend to experience lower unemployment rates.\rOther things being equal, this would be consistent with a slightly lower level of the equilibrium\runemployment rate than my current estimate of 5¼ percent. Thus, as the unemployment rate\rgrouping, I am likely to soon reduce my estimate of full employment to make it more consistent\rwith the absence of wage and price pressures we are experiencing.\rIt is quite possible that even if there are developing price pressures, they will not be\robvious in the data by the middle of next year. The Tealbook forecast has total and core PCE\rinflation for the second quarter of next year at 1.4 percent and the ECI at 2.8 percent for all four\rquarters of 2015. If this is close to the actual outcomes, we will have little evidence of progress\rtoward our 2 percent inflation goal based on wage and price data even by the middle of next\ryear.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r57 of 219\r\rThe very low wage and price pressures pose a challenge for deciding when liftoff should\roccur. One reason is that downward nominal wage rigidity may be complicating the signal that\rone can reasonably draw about labor market slack from current wage developments. Because\rmany businesses did not cut nominal wages outright during the recession or in the earlier part of\rthe recovery as equilibrium wages declined, we may now be observing slower wage growth to\rcompensate for the earlier lack of downward adjustment.\rOne way to overcome this difficulty is to look at the wages of new hires, which are\rtypically more sensitive to business cycle conditions than the wages of existing employees.\rNew-hire wages could potentially be a leading indicator of emerging labor market tightness. My\rstaff has been analyzing the monthly wage file from the CPS. After controlling for demographic\rfeatures of the data, they find that in previous recoveries, new-hire wages did grow significantly\rfaster than existing employee wages. However, to date in the current recovery, that pattern has\ryet to emerge strongly in the data. Thus, unlike previous recoveries, they are not yet seeing\rmuch evidence of wage pressures and that is consistent with there still being significant labor\rNeedless to say, it is important not to focus solely on one indicator when assessing price\rand wage pressures and their relationship with the extent of slack in the economy. Prices are\raffected by variables other than past wage movements. Hence, they can move before wages.\rFurthermore, the statistical relationship between aggregate wages and most real measures of\rlabor market slack is not always stable. Finally, because of recent exchange rate and oil price\rshocks, it may be particularly difficult to determine underlying wage and price trends. Still, at\rleast so far, the bulk of evidence appears consistent with little incipient inflationary pressures.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r58 of 219\r\rIn this context, there appears to be ample reason for patience. That is particularly true\rgiven the disinflation in Europe and Japan and the recent turbulence generated by sharply lower\roil prices, which calls into question the robustness of a global recovery. However, it would be\rimportant to parse incoming wage and price data carefully. The very low breakevens and fiveyear Treasury rates well below 2 percent, even though most investors expect us to tighten\rstarting next year, indicate that we are still in danger of undermining our credibility on our\rinflation target. The European quandary highlights why we should not take this risk lightly.\rAll of the above provide ample reason to probe the degree of labor market slack further\rand to look for signs that we can confidently expect to move back to our inflation target over the\rforecast horizon. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Evans.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Thank you, Madam Chair. The basic contours of my outlook have not\rchanged materially over the past two SEP cycles. President Fisher, you had a very interesting\rterm. I’m not sure I captured it correctly—SEP “projection-ologist” or something.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Dot-ologist.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Dot-ologist. Okay. I’m number eight. We see GDP growth averaging\rabout 3 percent over the next two years. This is a faster pace than the Tealbook, and it largely\rreflects our higher assumption for potential output growth.\rThus, we too see the unemployment rate falling close to 5 percent by the end of 2016.\rAfter a long period of unemployment and resource slack, we will have finally arrived at a\rsatisfactory outcome for the employment side of the dual mandate. But also like the Tealbook,\rwe project that the FOMC will fail to achieve its inflation objective within the SEP forecast\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r59 of 219\r\rperiod. My forecast has inflation slowly crawling up and not getting back to 2 percent until\rsometime in 2018.\rRecall that since 2008, PCE inflation has averaged just 1½ percent per year. So under\rmy SEP forecast we will have missed our inflation target for ten years. I continue to see this\routcome as highly unsatisfactory. Moreover, for the FOMC to achieve even this unsatisfactory\routcome, I find it necessary to assume greater monetary accommodation than the Tealbook, the\rmedian SEP dot path, and 15 other SEP submissions.\rConditional on my reading of economic and inflation fundamentals, I don’t have the\rfunds rate lifting off until March 2016. Frankly, I think truly appropriate policy would have us\rachieving our 2 percent goal before 2018. That would require even stronger accommodation\rthan I’m writing down. By the way, it’s essential to describe my policy assumption to give a\rbetter context to my SEP economic commentary.\rNow, returning to the outlook, the recent data on consumer spending and the labor market\rhave been somewhat better than we expected, and as a result, we boosted our near-term forecast\ra bit. My business contacts and directors indicate that not much has changed since last time.\rMost reports are positive about prospects for continued strength in the U.S. economy.\rFor example, automakers, not surprisingly, were pleased with the November sales\rnumbers. Looking ahead, both Ford and GM expect sales in 2015 to be up a bit from this year’s\rpace. They also are benefiting from consumers buying more expensive vehicles, and they\rsuggested that continued attractive financing rates are likely to be important for a continuation of\rstrong consumer sales. But, not to be too upbeat, U.S. automakers do note that their foreign\rcompetitors are getting an edge in the marketplace from the stronger dollar. They like to talk\rlike that.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r60 of 219\r\rMore generally, my directors and other contacts continue to be gloomy about the\rinternational situation. Most of the commentary was similar to the last round, although some\rmentioned that their businesses in Europe had weakened even further.\rLike many, I see the international situation as the major downside risk to the U.S. growth\routlook. At only 3 percent growth, the U.S. economy is not likely to pull up the rest of the\rworld. They’re going to have to do it largely on their own. But I’m also concerned that the U.S.\reconomy will not be able to decouple completely from the rest of the world. The CEOs I speak\rwith describe Europe as a mess. Matters there certainly could get worse, especially if\rpolicymakers simply muddle along. And a worsening Europe could have a substantial negative\rimpact on U.S. corporate risk aversion and, with that, on domestic investment and hiring.\rNow, let me turn to inflation. The bulk of the incoming information has been\rdiscouraging. First, aggregate wage increases continue to be very modest. One CEO of a large\rfirm told me that they were raising wages by 3 to 6 percent for some lower-paid, second-tier jobs\rin the $12 to $16 an hour wage range. But it turns out that this follows a wage freeze last year.\rFurthermore, the same CEO indicated that he sees no inflationary pressures. He reiterated by\rsaying, “Zero.” Next, the further drop in oil prices and appreciation of the dollar will lower\rinflation, at least in the near term. Third, market measures of inflation compensation have fallen\reven further. Although this move may be difficult to parse, some portion of it ought to be due to\rlower expected inflation, as the dealer survey suggested. This is going in the wrong direction.\rTo conclude, my outlook for inflation is nowhere near satisfactory, in my opinion. Over\rthe past six years, inflation has averaged 1½ percent per year. Over the next five years, I expect\rthat inflation will average only 1¾ percent. Putting us on a path that returns inflation to target\rsooner rather than later should be our paramount concern at this time. Getting stuck at\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r61 of 219\r\r1¾ percent would be a credibility failure of our long-run strategy for monetary policy.

All signs confirm that the expansion is on\rtrack. Consumer spending has been surprisingly strong, supported by falling energy prices,\rimproving household balance sheets, and renewed confidence. Strength in the manufacturing\rsector is also noteworthy, with capacity utilization in that sector near historical norms. I\rcontinue to expect real GDP growth to run well above potential output through next year, and my\rcontacts are actually, nowadays, more upbeat about the outlook—which is a big change—telling\rme that there’s more upside than downside risk to my forecast.\rOn the jobs front, at our previous FOMC meeting, I think I referred to recent gains as\r“robust.” With the further pickups over the past two months, I guess I’ll have to say that they\rwere very robust, and the unemployment rate has also edged down, accompanied by\rimprovement in a wide set of labor market indicators. In this wave of transparency, I am SEP\rrespondent number five and will not go through all of the details of my forecast, unless everyone\rwould like to hear it.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Nobody will know for five years.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLIAMS. As labor market conditions continue to improve, the question of what\rconstitutes maximum employment becomes a more pressing topic that President Lacker already\rtalked about. Distinguishing between structural and cyclical factors in labor markets is essential\rto this question, and my staff, like others in the System, as already mentioned, have been\rworking to provide some answers to this question.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r62 of 219\r\rOne structural factor that’s been a concern of late is job polarization, which refers to the\rdisappearance of middle-skill, routine jobs that are replaced by computer-based technologies or\rare offshored. Although this process has been ongoing for three decades now, it accelerated\rduring the recent recession and may have left a sizable number of routine jobs permanently\rdislocated.\rMy staff examined the extent to which this type of structural job loss has contributed to\rthe mismatch and pushed up the natural rate of unemployment during the latest downturn and\rrecovery. They found only minimal effects, largely consistent with earlier research conducted by\rthe staff of the New York Fed. Workers in routine jobs have seen a pickup in their job-finding\rrates similar to workers with more favored nonroutine jobs, and, more generally, job mismatches\rassociated with polarization appear to be limited, boosting the unemployment rate by only\r¼ percentage point at most. To further probe the role of mismatch, my staff also updated their\rearlier work on the interaction between the Beveridge curve and aggregate labor demand, as\rreflected in the job creation curve, and their results, which encompass a full range of sources of\rmismatch, also shows a limited effect of mismatch today.\rCombined, these findings and the other research that was done in recent years on this\rtopic add to my confidence that the long-term natural rate has not risen by a significant amount\rin the aftermath of the recession. My estimate of the natural rate remains at 5.2 percent, and I\rsee the actual unemployment rate converging on that milepost by the end of next year. That’s\runchanged from my September forecast.\rGiven the sizable improvement in the labor market, inflation is now the most worrying\rissue. It’s been running too low for quite some time, and declines in energy prices, commodity\rprices, and import prices will push down the headline numbers further through next year. Still,\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r63 of 219\r\rcore inflation has not slipped, and as commodity prices and the dollar stabilize and domestic\rwages pick up, I expect inflation to gradually rise and reach our longer-term objective in 2017.\rIndeed, the possibility of a bounceback in oil prices as market conditions normalize adds\rsome upside risk to the forecast. Let me add a little bit of commentary on that. That’s been the\rbig topic of discussion at our board meetings and in discussions with contacts. I think this is an\rinteresting comparison between what’s happening in Texas, where there’s tight oil and the\rinvestment cycle is very short, and what’s happening with some of the global oil companies. In\rTexas, the return to investment is very rapid and, once you get the permit, you can go in, drill the\roil, get the oil out, and move out. When you think about global oil companies who are doing\rdeepwater research and drilling, these are projects that tend to take five to seven years to fully\rdevelop and bring back returns. In that area you do hear reports of significant changes in\rwillingness to invest in exploration, willingness to basically deploy capital, given not only the\rlow level of oil prices, but the uncertainty there.\rNow, I think the question that did come up is the one that President Fisher talked about—\rhow is this dynamic with Saudi Arabia going to play out? How long will that take? You\rmentioned, I think, a figure of a couple years. Some of our discussions suggested that this may\rcollapse or shift sooner than that, but it’s a matter of uncertainty. When you think about\rinvestment in this area, I think it’s something that would, given a long lead time, lead to a\rpullback in investment until some of this uncertainty clears up.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. May I clarify, Madam Chair? I was referring to Saudi Aramco in my\rnumbers, not just the titans of oil in Texas.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLIAMS. I think there is a different dynamic between different types of oil\rexploration and drilling. Okay. I think there is uncertainty around the future of oil prices, and\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r64 of 219\r\rwe could see a jump back up in the next year or so. This outlook for gradually rising inflation is\rsupported by the continuation of well-anchored inflation expectations. I agree with President\rFisher, I believe inflation expectations have remained well anchored. And I remain steadfast in\rmy view that I don’t agree with the Board’s staff view that inflation expectations are anchored\rbelow 2 percent. I think they are actually anchored at 2 percent, so let me explain that a little bit.\rIn the Survey of Professional Forecasters, long-term expectations of PCE and price inflation\rhave been glued to 2 percent—that’s 2.0 percent—over the past two years. That sounds like\rsuccess to me. Although CPI long-run inflation expectations have come down a touch, analysis\rby my staff suggests that this is much ado about nothing.\rFirst, the drop is small. But, more importantly, it mainly served to bring the midpoint of\rthe distribution of expectations back down from elevated levels recorded in the aftermath of the\rfinancial crisis. The recent decline mainly reflects lower inflation expectations among\rrespondents whose earlier expectations were unusually high. Some of those respondents, when\rasked, “Why did you have high inflation expectations?” attributed their elevated responses, in\rpart, to the uncertainty about the inflationary impact of the Fed’s ballooning balance sheet. If\ryou think about the dynamic of inflation expectations on the CPI, basically the reason they went\rup, at least in part, was concerns about the Fed’s policy actions. Clearly, as President Rosengren\rpointed out, inflation has not risen. These risks have not materialized. They have actually\rshifted down their views of long-run inflation expectations from high to more in the middle.\rThe decline in inflation expectations among this group implies that respondents now\rshow much greater agreement about the likelihood of moderate inflation in the future. Now, of\rcourse, market-based measures of expected inflation and associated risks, in particular breakeven\rinflation rates, have come down by more than the survey-based measures. However, consistent\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r65 of 219\r\rwith the findings noted in the Tealbook, a model developed by my staff at the San Francisco Fed\rattributes these declines to risk and liquidity premiums rather than expected inflation.\rThat brings us to President Kocherlakota and his staff’s memo—which I thought was\rvery thought-provoking and very insightful—that basically made the point that we should not\rdistinguish between these two components, meaning inflation expectations and the inflation risk\rpremium. According to the memo, we should simply react to the full inflation compensation in\rorder to account for market participants’ valuation of the risks associated with different inflation\routcomes.\rNow, despite the theoretical elegance of his argument, and also my staff’s being thrilled\rto be able to talk about market-based probabilities and statistically estimated probabilities during\rthe FOMC briefing, I am unconvinced that market prices likely reflect the preferences of\rAmerican households in the way that the memo lays out. One reason is that a large share of\rAmerican households doesn’t actively participate in financial markets. Indeed, the marginal\rinvestor could well be a foreign hedge fund, which would invalidate the welfare rationale for\rusing market prices. Certainly, part of the recent decline in breakeven rates reflects a flight to\rsafety from abroad into nominal Treasuries. More generally, as highlighted by the field of\rbehavioral finance, there are a variety of reasons why sentiment and other factors and frictions\rnot associated with marginal utility might influence market prices.\rFurthermore, if the real world did approximate the framework of the full participation in\rcomplete markets assumed in the Minneapolis Fed’s memo, one implication of that is that our\rlarge-scale asset purchase programs would be ineffective. Without some imperfect\rsubstitutability among assets, such purchases would have no economic effects through portfolio\rbalance channels. My reading of the available evidence suggests that’s not the world that we\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r66 of 219\r\rlive in. For these reasons, I remain convinced that it makes sense, in theory, to consider inflation\rexpectations as well as the risk premium associated with inflation separately. But that’s in\rtheory. In practice, of course, we have imperfect tools to distinguish between these signals.\rGiven these measurement difficulties, we should not be too cavalier about the decline in\rbreakeven inflation and should continue to monitor and analyze it and other measures carefully.\rThank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. A two-hander—President Kocherlakota.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I thank President Williams\rand his staff for his close attention to the Minneapolis Fed memo, although I would\rrecommend—some of the sections that occur later in the memo on limited participation and\rincomplete markets might address some of the concerns that you raise in your remarks.\rI think a general point would be that we were trying to make—we may not have made it\ras clearly as we could have—is that it’s important to take into account relative valuations of\rresources across states of the world as well as the likelihood of those states of the world\roccurring. Basically, using probabilities alone is akin to counting up GDP by counting up how\rmuch things weigh as opposed to using values instead because, basically, probabilities don’t take\rinto account how much people actually value the resources in those different states of the world\rwhere you need to have a price to do that.\rNow, as President Williams and his staff pointed out, I think there are definitely issues\rabout how well financial market prices—and we tried to talk about some of that in the memo—\rmeasure exactly marginal valuations for everybody in the economy. I think there are reasons to\rthink they are relatively close, but that we can argue about. I think we should keep in mind that\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r67 of 219\r\rjust looking at probabilities alone is not sufficient, because we want to know how much people\rvalue resources, not just how likely states of the world are. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Lockhart.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will start with a summary of reports of\rcontacts from around my District. Overall, reports were quite positive. General demand\rconditions remain on the upswing, and demand for labor is rising. We also heard positive reports\ron the direction of capital expenditure outlays and plans. Neither the falling price of gasoline\rnor the rising dollar has yet materially affected the pace of business activity, although we heard\racknowledgement that both will come into play in 2015. I might add that one director talked\rabout the gasoline price having an effect on the composition of sales. The largest national auto\rretailer spoke about the preference of Americans now for SUVs and light trucks. He said,\r“Don’t listen to what the American public says. They say they want broccoli, but they want to\rbuy a donut.” [Laughter]\rWe had over 300 responses in response to the Board of Governors employment survey.\rFor us, almost 60 percent of respondents said they intend to increase employment over the next\r12 months. A significant plurality cited expected growth and sales as the most important factor\rpushing them to hire. We heard comments that higher turnover is beginning to present problems.\rCompensation growth, while still generally subdued, appears to be firming.\rComments on transport and logistics challenges were worthy of note. Contacts expressed\rsome concern about the growing vulnerability of the economy to transportation bottlenecks.\rThey cited the shortage of truck drivers and railcars as well as the Long Beach Port congestion.\rWe heard the view that transportation problems are likely to get worse.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r68 of 219\r\rOur reports from District contacts evidence rising confidence. Most interpretations of\rrecent national data, both inside the Fed and externally, emphasize the strength of the data, so the\rcautious contrarian in me says, “Don’t get carried away.” Let me mention some cautionary\rpoints on the current and near-term situation.\rTracking estimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth, including hours, point to a marked\rslowdown from well over 4 percent annualized third-quarter growth to down around 2½ percent\rthis quarter. Recent inflation readings remain well below the Committee’s target, with little\revidence of acceleration. Headline inflation numbers will likely be extremely soft in the first\rquarter, with widening divergence of headline and core. How to explain the declining marketbased indications of inflation expectations is not, in my opinion, a closed debate. Payroll jobs\rgrowth is certainly quite strong and encouraging. But considering the level of U-6, the still\relevated U-3/U-6 differential, and continuing weak wage growth, I still see a fair measure of\remployment slack remaining.\rThese are just cautionary comments. My baseline forecast submitted for this meeting has\rnot substantially changed from October and September. My central assumption is that the\reconomy will continue to enjoy an underlying run rate of growth around 3 percent. In that\rrespect, my forecast sees stronger growth than the December Tealbook by more than\r½ percentage point. I adjusted down my headline inflation projection over the next year,\rreflecting the playing through of the drop in oil prices. I have core inflation slightly above the\rTealbook over the forecast horizon but do not have core or headline inflation reaching target\runtil 2017.\rAs regards risks to my outlook, I share the view that substantially lower gasoline and\renergy prices will likely produce a clear benefit to the real economy in the medium term. My\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r69 of 219\r\rstaff did some statistical modeling of the effect of lower oil prices. This work suggested positive\rconsumption and investment effects materializing in the second half of 2015. However, the\rshare of oil and gas structures investment, as a percentage of total investment in structures, has\rgrown significantly since the mid-1990s. As a consequence, the effect of sustained low oil\rprices on drilling activity could be a slight drag on growth in the near term.\rA second risk to my outlook relates to the impact of a stronger dollar on net exports in the\rcontext of weak global growth. The Tealbook seems to have incorporated effects of these factors\rinto their baseline growth forecast. I have not yet done so. Given the structure of U.S. exports, I\rdon’t feel I am on firm ground estimating the downside effect of the higher dollar on exports. I\ram also uncertain about the second-quarter positive effects on our economy, of what one would\rexpect to be stronger export performance growth and ultimate demand in economies whose\rcurrency has depreciated.\rI found the exercise of projecting economic conditions at liftoff to be quite useful. Like\rthe Tealbook, I can imagine circumstances leading up to liftoff when the incoming data and nearterm outlook could be very short of our mandated objectives. Assuming a mid-2015 liftoff date,\rour communications in anticipation of liftoff will probably begin as early as the March FOMC\rmeeting. At this time, it is likely, in my view, that headline PCE inflation will be moving\rsharply away from our longer-term objective. The decline in oil prices to date could contribute\rto negative headline inflation through the February PCE price report. At the same time, we\rcould be looking at a two-quarter growth rate for this quarter and next, well below the average of\rthe second and third quarters of 2014.\rMy point is that the array of data relative to mandate could be confidence challenging and\rrequire that the Committee look through, discount, and explain away aspects of the picture\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r70 of 219\r\rpresented by the data. This could be an awkward place to be as we approach liftoff. I will pick\rup on this thought again in the policy round. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Mester.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. MESTER. Thank you, Madam Chair. My overall view is that the economy is\rbuilding momentum in terms of output and employment. The Fourth District economy continues\rto expand. Fifty percent of our contacts reported an improvement in business conditions over the\rpast six to eight weeks compared with 10 percent that reported a deterioration. This yields an\rimplied diffusion index of 40, slightly less than the 47 we saw at the time of our previous\rmeeting but significantly higher than the 10 we saw last December.\rFourth District business contacts remain optimistic about the economy. Indeed, over half\rplan to increase capital spending next year. In many cases, this investment is being made to\rexpand capacity rather than merely replace depreciated equipment. Conditions in District labor\r1.4 percent, the closest the region has come to the nation’s growth rate in several years.\rAnecdotal reports on hiring plans for the coming year continue to indicate steadily improving\rlabor markets.\rThe unemployment rate for the four states in our District fell to 5.3 percent in October,\rdown almost 1½ percentage points since the end of last year. The decline in unemployment, the\rpickup in employment growth, and anecdotal reports of increased plans to hire all paint a\rfavorable labor market picture for the Fourth District.\rWe do not yet see much evidence of broad wage or price pressures either up or down.\rMy directors continue to report that wage gains are moderate in the 2 to 3 percent range, on\raverage. Manufacturers reported that lower-skilled production jobs are readily filled without\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r71 of 219\r\rsignificant wage growth. However, we also continue to receive reports of wage pressures\rincreasing for hard-to-find skills and also in high-cost locations. In general, prices for finished\rgoods remain stable, although we have received reports of higher nonlabor input costs, such as\rfreight charges, despite the lower fuel costs.\rMy view of the national economy is little changed since the previous meeting. Incoming\rinformation has largely been positive and has given me more confidence that momentum is\rincreasing. Growth is picking up, and labor markets continue to improve. We see this across a\rbroad range of indicators, including payroll and household employment, and job openings and\rquits in JOLTS, which are trending higher and have recently hit multiyear highs.\rThe percentage of the labor force employed part time for economic reasons remains\relevated relative to the period from about 1995 until the crisis, but it, too, has declined\rsignificantly and stands at the level we saw in the early 1990s. There are even tentative signs\rfrom the employment cost index that wage gains may be starting to pick up.\rOver the intermeeting period, headline inflation has moved further below our target of\r2 percent, driven by the sharp decline in oil prices. This change in prices partly reflects weaker\rglobal demand, but most analyses indicate that it has been driven mainly by supply changes. So\rfar there’s been little pass-through to core inflation measures, which have remained relatively\rstable. I’m not anticipating much pass-through because, although results vary across studies,\rmost of the research, including that by the Cleveland Fed staff, suggests that pass-through of\renergy price shocks to core inflation has been fairly muted since the 1990s.\rOn balance, lower oil prices should be a net positive for the U.S. economy, although a\rfair amount of media attention is focused on the negative effects on domestic oil producers. So\rlong as inflation expectations remain anchored, the appropriate monetary policy response to a\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r72 of 219\r\rnegative oil supply shock would not be to increase the level of accommodation. Indeed, the\rpositive effect on growth from the drop in oil prices will point to slightly tighter policy being\rappropriate. Of course, this is dependent on inflation expectations remaining anchored. I do not\rfind the declines we’ve seen in some of the market-based inflation compensation measures as\rthat troubling yet. So far the changes in expectations are within the ranges we’ve seen in recent\ryears and partly reflect changes in liquidity and risk premiums.\rThe Cleveland Fed’s 10-year CPI inflation expectations measure, which was mentioned\rearlier, has remained quite stable near 2 percent. Survey measures like the SPF have also been\rstable, and as the Board staff indicates, the decline in the medium-run inflation expectations\rmeasure from the Michigan survey could be reflecting the sharp drop in oil prices rather than a\rsustained drop in inflation expectations. I do think we need to keep our eyes on inflation\rdevelopments. We also should remember that inflation expectations are endogenous. To the\rextent that we believe that the downward pressure on inflation is transitory, we should make sure\rthat message is conveyed.\rMy outlook remains positive. I continue to project GDP growth to be about 3 percent\rover the next couple of years before returning to trend growth of 2½ percent in 2017. The\rfactors supporting above-trend growth include highly accommodative monetary policy,\rimproving household and business balance sheets and confidence, and strengthening labor\rthe forecast horizon, slightly undershooting and then returning to 5½ percent, my estimate of the\rlonger-run unemployment rate, in 2017. Lower oil and commodity prices will temporarily lower\rheadline inflation, but as these prices stabilize, the economy continues to expand at a slightly\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r73 of 219\r\rabove-trend pace, and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable. I project inflation to\rgradually rise to our 2 percent objective by the end of 2016.\rMy projections are dependent on appropriate monetary policy, which, in my view, should\rreflect actual and projected progress toward the Committee objectives, including the speed with\rwhich progress is being made. I believe we should recognize the substantial progress we’ve\rmade toward our goal of full employment. I expect that progress to continue, perhaps at an\raccelerated pace. Under these conditions, a key condition informing my expected liftoff of the\rfed funds rate from the zero lower bound is when projected inflation between one and two years\rahead reaches the Committee’s goal of 2 percent. My projection continues to show us reaching\rthis liftoff condition in the first quarter of 2015, and I’ve incorporated this into my projections.\rAfter liftoff, as the expansion continues at an above-trend rate in my projection, I believe it will\rbe appropriate to raise interest rates gradually for a time, similar to a path suggested by a Taylor\r1999 rule with inertia, but then to raise rates at a pace more in line with a less inertial Taylor\rrule.\rThere continue to be a number of risks to the forecast, but I view these as balanced. The\rrecent volatility in private financial markets, driven by the drop in oil prices, has a potential for\rbroader spillovers. Also, conditions abroad may have worsened since our October meeting. On\rthe other hand, there also seem to be better prospects now for an effective policy response in key\reconomies there, including the euro area.\rOn the positive side, U.S. growth and employment may be picking up at a faster pace\rthan projected, which suggests we’re getting close to liftoff, and we should remain focused on\rpreparing the public for it. I’m not sure the public understands that forward-looking monetary\rpolicy means it will be appropriate to begin reducing the degree of policy accommodation when\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r74 of 219\r\rthe outlook calls for future inflation to be at our goal even though trailing headline inflation is\rbelow our goal, and, similarly, when the unemployment rate is not yet at its estimated long-run\rlevel. Indeed, the SEP indicates that all but one participant sees inflation below 2 percent at the\rtime of liftoff, and all but five see inflation at 1 percent or less at the time of liftoff.\rIn our desire to clarify that we take the downside risk to inflation very seriously, we may\rhave conveyed less of the consensus view that the effect of the oil price shock on inflation is\rlikely to be transitory, and that lower oil prices are likely to be a net positive for the U.S.\reconomy. I’m concerned that people have taken too negative a read of our views and haven’t\rfully appreciated the positive developments. Unless the public understands the outlook as we see\rit, I’m not sure they’ll understand the rationale for our change in policy, whenever that time\rcomes.

The Eighth District economy continued to\rexpand during the intermeeting period. The unemployment rate across District MSAs dropped to\r6.0 percent during the most recent reporting period, just 0.2 higher than the national\runemployment rate. Before the 2007–09 recession, the District unemployment rate tended to run\rslightly higher than the national average. During much of the past five years, however, the\rnational unemployment rate was notably higher than what we measured in the Eighth District.\rThe fact that these two rates have returned to their historical relationship during 2014 can be\rtaken as a sign of a return to normalcy in U.S. labor markets.\rEighth District business contacts surveyed during the intermeeting period expressed a\rgenerally optimistic outlook for local economic conditions in 2015. In particular, 63 percent said\rthey expect business conditions to improve further in 2015, while only 5 percent said they expect\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r75 of 219\r\rbusiness conditions to be worse. Anecdotal information also suggests a slight increase in prices\rduring the fourth quarter. Sixty-five percent of contacts reported that prices charged to\rconsumers have stayed about the same as a year ago, while 21 percent reported an increase and\r14 percent reported a decrease. First-quarter expectations suggest an upward movement in prices\rwith about half of business contacts expecting to keep prices unchanged and 34 percent\rexpecting to increase them. I took this to indicate deflation is not imminent.\rBusiness contacts with a national footprint were optimistic about the current holiday\rseason. A contact at a very large retailer felt that the climate for consumer expenditures will be\rmuch stronger this holiday season than last year due to decreasing gasoline prices and a more\rstable political environment in Washington. Another very large retailer reported strong demand\rfor electronics as well as impressive foot traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores.\rWe are hearing continuing reports of serious congestion problems in the national railway\rsystem, tending to slow down service and push up costs, as President Lockhart alluded to. A\rlogistics firm that hires tens of thousands of temporary workers during the holiday season said it\rexpects to keep more of these workers on after the holidays than it has in the past. I found these\ranecdotal reports encouraging.\rFor the national economy, in my view the story continues to be that the U.S. economy\rhas considerable momentum and is being further aided by two tailwinds: a lower rate structure\ras compared with several months ago and a sharp drop in oil and gasoline prices. For the\rmomentum part of the story, we can consider that GDP growth has likely been in excess of\r4 percent at an annual rate over the second and third quarters of 2014, and that many privatesector tracking estimates of current-quarter GDP growth are running about 3 percent.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r76 of 219\r\rBased on my discussions with CEO District contacts, I think there may be some upside\rrisk to the 3 percent number, so that early next year we could be looking at three very strong\rGDP growth quarters in a row. Commensurate with this robust performance, labor markets have\rbeen improving more rapidly than many around this table anticipated. Unemployment will likely\rcontinue to tick down and is within just a few jobs reports of the Committee’s central tendency\rfor the long-run value of this important variable. In addition, some recent reports on retail sales,\rconsumer confidence, and industrial production seem to confirm a narrative of substantial\reconomic strength.\rBased on the performance of the real economy alone, my judgment is that the Committee\rcan no longer justify its continued zero-rate policy. These data are far too hot to rationalize what\rwas really an unprecedented emergency policy in reaction to a very severe crisis. Even for those\rwho think my characterization of the U.S. economy is too rosy, I think that the most that can be\rsaid is that the Committee should perhaps be running a policy with rates somewhat below\rnormal, but not pinned down all the way to the floor at zero. Even as we begin to normalize the\rpolicy rate next year, monetary policy will likely remain very accommodative for several years.\rThe real economy is strongly signaling that we need to get on with this process before it gets\raway from us and causes us to take more drastic action later or possibly face a new crisis.\rI might also remark that, in terms of goal variables, if you take unemployment and\rinflation and you put a quadratic objective on them and look at how far inflation is from target\rand how far unemployment is from target, we’re about as close as the Committee has ever been\rto our goal variables in that respect. We’re closer than we have been 90 percent of the time since\r1960.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r77 of 219\r\rThere are two caveats to the view that I just outlined. One is the international situation\rand the other is inflation. Concerning the international outlook, many in financial markets have\rbeen concerned that slower growth in Europe, Japan, and China bodes ill for the U.S.\rmacroeconomic outlook. We also saw part of the Tealbook looking at a scenario of weaker\rforeign growth. I do not think that the situation as it currently stands is threatening to the United\rStates in a direct sense. While there is certainly some direct effect on the United States from\rslower global growth, my sense is that the United States is actually likely to benefit from a lower\rrate structure globally than would have otherwise occurred and from lower oil and gasoline\rprices than would have otherwise occurred.\rThe risk, from the perspective of this Committee, with respect to foreign developments is\rthat weak economic performance abroad morphs into a full-blown financial crisis, most likely in\rEurope or China, as it did in Europe in 2011 and 2012. Developments in that direction would\rhave important impacts on U.S. financial markets and likely on U.S. macroeconomic\rperformance. However, as we sit here today, I do not see this as something that we can predict\rwith much accuracy, and I do not think it is any more likely today than it has been since ECB\rPresident Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech in London in 2012 brought the previous crisis to a\rconclusion.\rDomestic inflation has been running below the Committee’s target, but my current\rforecast continues to call for inflation returning to target over the medium term. The fact that\rinflation is running below target is enough to justify a policy rate that is somewhat lower than\rnormal, but it is not enough to justify a policy rate that remains pinned down at zero. According\rto leading New Keynesian theories, the main determinant of actual inflation is inflation\rexpectations, and, in this regard, the steep decline in TIPS breakeven inflation rates is quite\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r78 of 219\r\rdisconcerting. I also learned a lot from President Kocherlakota’s memo on inflation and\rinflation expectations and inflation risk premiums. My view is that the Board staff is too quick\rto dismiss these important market developments on inflation expectations.\rThe worry for me is not so much that year-over-year PCE inflation remains somewhat\rlow, but rather that the shift in inflation expectations is so severe that actual inflation begins to\rfall further just at the point when the Committee is trying to take on board the robust\rdevelopments in the real economy. This may create a situation in which inflation expectations\rand actual inflation continue to fall instead of rising back toward target as I expect.\rA modern central bank cannot afford to be complacent about inflation expectations that\rare shifting away from target over periods as long as 5 and 10 years. This problem is severe\renough—the 5-year TIPS breakeven was 115 basis points on Friday—that the Committee needs\rto be prepared to arrest this trend if necessary. I will discuss ways to be prepared for this\rpossibility more in my policy remarks tomorrow. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.

Economic activity continues to grow\rmoderately, and expectations of future activity remain very optimistic. Our Manufacturing\rBusiness Outlook Survey current activity index for November came in at an extraordinarily high\rnumber of 40.8, the highest reading since 1993. Unfortunately, most of that was in seasonaladjustment factors and probably wasn’t expected to be sustained. Nonetheless, it still showed\rgreat strength. The industrial production numbers that came in just this week showed very\rstrong activity, as has been noted several times, and also the capacity utilization rate was very\rhigh, almost near historical averages. Very strong performance.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r79 of 219\r\rLooking ahead to our December BOS results, which will be released on Thursday at\r10:00 a.m., they pulled back, as we probably expected, from the 40 to 23.2, which is about where\rthey were in October, the month before—still a very strong number and well above the sort of\rnonrecessionary averages for that survey. Even though it fell back, it’s still a very strong\rnumber.\rContacts in the region confirm this assessment, as do most of our recent state indicators,\rwhich are composed mostly of employment growth, unemployment rates, manufacturing hours,\rand wage and salary data. Growth is broad based across a wide range of manufacturing\rcategories. This strength is mirrored in our new Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey.\rIts current activity index remains at a high level of 41.2. Just as important, though, is the Future\rGeneral Activity Index, which continues to show a high degree of optimism in the District. At\r54.1 in December—again, to be announced on Thursday—it is relatively close to where it was\rthe previous month, which was 57.7—again, very high numbers for optimism.\rMoreover, there is a new statistic we have created that measures the dispersion of the\rresponses for future activity and has shown a marked decline in recent months; based on our\rresearch, this indicates less uncertainty about the future than perhaps existed in the past, which is\ralso encouraging. A reduction in this uncertainty statistic, we found, is indicative of future\rstrength in our index for capital expenditures.\rThe results of a special question on labor markets, which was summarized in the staff\rbriefing earlier, showed continued improvement. Fifty-six percent of the manufacturers said\rthey expected to hire additional workers over the next 12 months. That is up from 45 percent in\r44 percent in January.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r80 of 219\r\rAs in the nation, auto sales in the District are robust. Non-auto retailers contacted around\rThanksgiving reported modest growth. Construction of high-rise office buildings in Center City\ris robust. It now includes the new Comcast Tower, which has shown up in the F.W. Dodge\rindex for the value of contracts for nonresidential buildings, creating a huge spike in our local\rcontracting number. There are two other buildings coming on line soon. However, as indicated\rby growth of only 2 percent in permits for single-family housing, residential real estate is\rexhibiting, at best, only modest growth and modest house price appreciation, and the modest\rhouse price appreciation we have experienced has slowed even a bit more. On the other hand,\rthe multifamily sector of the market remains very strong.\rRegarding the national outlook, my view has not really changed very much since our last\ra change in my forecast but in me becoming more confident about the sustainability of the\rgrowth we have seen and about my outlook in general. A portion of that optimism revolves\raround continued increasing strength in the labor market. And 2014 will likely see the strongest\rchange in employment in any calendar year since 1999 and the strongest 12-month interval by\rthe end of this year of any period since early 2000. It’s a pretty extraordinary record to have the\rstrongest employment growth in nearly a decade and a half.\rNow, this strength should support somewhat stronger-than-trend growth, in my view, in\r2015. Moreover, a wide range of other labor market conditions, including broader measures of\runemployment and the JOLTS data, are also consistent with continued improvements in the\rlabor market. Given the ongoing strength in the labor market, a continued consistent decline in\rhousehold debt-to-income ratios, improved household access to credit, and falling prices at the\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r81 of 219\r\rpump, I project that consumer spending will grow slightly above trend next year. I anticipate\rthat business investment will grow at about trend and residential investment will grow modestly.\rPutting these broad features together leads me to continue anticipating aggregate growth\rof about 3 percent next year, falling to about 2.6 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017, which\ris near the high end of my estimate for trend growth, which is between 2.3 and 2.5 percent. By\rthe way, I am number 14, if anybody is interested.\rI think we need to look at what has happened in the past year. It’s pretty remarkable. In\rthe third quarter of 2013, real GDP growth was 4½ percent. In the fourth quarter of 2013,\r3½ percent. Of course, then we had the aberration in the first quarter with the winter, which was\rnegative 2 percent; second quarter of 2014, 4.6 percent; third quarter of 2014, 4.6 percent. At\rleast those are the current estimates. The fourth quarter of 2014 is likely to be close to 3 percent.\rThat is five out of six quarters of 3½-plus percent growth. That’s a pretty extraordinary record\rfor the past five quarters. How much evidence does it take us to believe that policy needs to\radjust to that strong growth and become a little less accommodative than zero interest rates?\rContinued labor market strength leads me to forecast the unemployment rate falling to\r5.7 percent by the end of this year. Next year we will see it continue to fall, although probably at\ra somewhat slower rate, because we are almost at what we think is the long-term sustainable\rpace. We are very near our unemployment rate range that the Committee has for the sustainable\rrate in the long term. I think we will be at 5.4 percent before the middle of next year, and that\rwill begin slowly shrinking, reaching only 5.3 percent by the end of next year.\rHeadline inflation will be somewhat softer over the next couple of quarters, as we all\rknow, reflecting the decline in energy prices. But those prices should stabilize, and headline\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r82 of 219\r\rinflation will return to that 1½ to 2 percent range over the second half of next year and, I believe,\rconverge to 2 percent in 2016.\rThis Committee correctly looked through the very large oil price increases and the\rincreases in headline inflation that we witnessed in 2011, when headline inflation reached over\r3 percent in some months and in some quarters. We need to do the same thing here. We should\rnot let the change in relative prices and their effects on headline inflation drive us to largely\rreassess our view of inflation in the longer term. Again, as many people have said, as long as\rinflation expectations remain well anchored—and I believe they are—I’m not going to repeat the\revidence that others have offered.\rMy own view of appropriate policy is somewhat different from my previous SEP\rsubmission. I have reduced my long-run neutral rate from 4 to 3.75 percent, which I think is\rconsistent mostly for demographic reasons. I have also reduced my policy rate because the rules\rI follow suggest that inflation is going to get back to 2 percent a little later than I previously\rthought. That is cause for making a more gradual adjustment in my policy rate.\rMy path calls for liftoff in the first quarter of next year, with gradual rate hikes reaching\ran IOER rate of 2 percent, but I guess we don’t use IOER—1.875 percent for the midpoint of the\rfederal funds rate target range, to be more precise, by the end of next year. I believe by 2017 we\rshould be at our long-run neutral rate of 3.75 percent. I think this path is both feasible and\rdesirable, is gradual, and is measured in its approach. However, I continue to be concerned that\rif we do not begin this process reasonably promptly, we will face a much higher risk of having to\rraise rates much more quickly and, thus, returning to those old go-stop policies of the past.\rWhen we do that, we will induce greater, not less, economic and financial instability in the years\rto come.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r83 of 219\r\rThus, while the Committee may still believe that June is a reasonable expectation for\rliftoff, I believe it is very important that we convey in our language and our messaging to the\rquarter. We may not lift off in the first quarter, but the more we encourage the markets to have\rzero probability on that event, when the time comes for us to move—if that happens to be earlier\rthan the market expects—then we will probably be faced with having to surprise the market\rsubstantially and create more volatility than would indeed be necessary.

The Tenth District economy has continued to\rexpand at a relatively steady pace, with the exception of energy and agricultural production.\rMost of our industry contacts note positive expectations for both consumer spending and\rbusiness activity in the months ahead.\rDistrict labor markets have improved further alongside an expanding economy.\rExemplifying the recent strength, unemployment rates declined considerably in October, with\rfive of the District’s seven states reporting unemployment rates that range from a low of\r3.4 percent in Nebraska to 4.7 percent in Wyoming. Recent surveys showed that firms expected\rwage increases to average just over 3 percent for their current employees, while wage increases\rfor new employees were reported to be considerably higher, averaging 4.7 percent. Wage\rincreases were expected to be especially prevalent for skilled positions in transportation,\rbanking, IT, and construction.\rA large trucking firm reported that drivers’ wages would be increased 13 percent,\reffective in January. In agriculture, low crop prices are expected to stress some producers over\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r84 of 219\r\rthe coming year as working capital erodes because of weaker profit margins. For the most part,\rhowever, farmland values have remained relatively steady despite weaker incomes.\rWith respect to District energy producers, the steady decline in oil prices has led to\rdiminished expectations for drilling activity next year. One District contact currently expects\rthat if oil prices are in the $60 to $70 range next year, there will be a 20 percent decline in capex. The declines should occur gradually based on existing leasing arrangements on drilling\requipment and the fact that many firms have hedged prices for about half of their production\rnext year. Larger declines in production activity and corresponding layoffs could occur if low\rprices persist into 2016.\rMy outlook for the national economy is little changed since our previous meeting, and\rmy confidence in the economy’s fundamentals continues to grow. A stronger labor market\racross many dimensions points to a sustainable growth outlook. With payroll growth averaging\r250,000 per month over the past six months, labor demand has picked up for middle-skill jobs,\rthose that were most negatively affected during the recession. Correspondingly, employment\rgrowth has picked up for workers with a high school diploma and some college education, two\rgroups of workers that had experienced only limited recovery prior to this year.\rThe Board staff memos on the labor market and cyclical dynamics offered useful insights\ron the progress toward our objectives. Similarly, my staff constructed a measure that offers\radditional information on the amount of spare capacity in the economy. It combines four\rdifferent output gap measures along with fiscal policy information, such as personal current tax\rand corporate tax receipts, to produce a sort of composite output gap.\rThis measure shows the current output gap in the range of about 1 percent. Assuming\rtrend growth of 2 percent, a growth rate of 3 percent over the next year will eliminate the excess\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r85 of 219\r\rcapacity in the economy according to this measure. If labor market conditions continue to\revolve at a similar pace of improvement, as we have seen over the past 12 months, the economy\rlooks to be about a year away from full capacity and full employment.\rWith the labor market approaching a level consistent with sustainable long-run economic\rgrowth, upward pressure on wages should begin to emerge. As the quits rate has increased over\rthe past two years, average wage growth from job switchers has risen from roughly 4.3 percent\rper quarter in early 2013 to 5.6 percent in the third quarter of this year. Wage growth was\rhighest for switchers in leisure and hospitality and professional and business services. It was\rlower for switchers in manufacturing, education, and health industries. With the quits rates\rrising and returning to pre-recession levels, I expect to see even greater wage growth for job\rswitchers, and eventually for others, as competitive pressures take hold.\rRegarding inflation, I expect in the near term there will be downward pressure on\rdomestic prices exerted by slower global growth and the recent shifts in foreign exchange rates.\rIf energy prices should continue to fall, we could see inflation expectations sag.\rNotwithstanding such risk, I expect that strong economic growth and a return of labor market\rconditions toward full employment levels over the next year will move inflation toward our\rtarget level within the next two years. In particular, increasing nominal wage growth should\rprovide upward pressure on inflation, particularly in labor-intensive industries such as the\rservices sector, for which the recent QSS report showed stronger-than-expected consumption of\rservices in the second half of 2014.

I plan to discuss my troubling\rinflation outlook, some evidence from labor markets in support of that outlook, and the\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r86 of 219\r\rcredibility risk posed by that outlook. When I talk about my inflation outlook, I just want to be\rclear about my monetary policy assumption. My monetary policy assumption that I’m going to\rbe using for the purpose of these remarks is similar to that in Tealbook A, so liftoff in the second\rquarter of 2015. That differs from what I do see as appropriate monetary policy. I’m respondent\rnumber 10 in the SEP. Like financial markets, I see the fed funds rate at the end of 2017 as\rbeing around 2 percent, and so my path for the fed funds rate is considerably lower than the\rcentral tendency of this Committee or as modeled in Tealbook A. But, for the purposes of these\rremarks, as I said at the beginning, I’m going to be using the same monetary policy assumption\ras described in Tealbook A. Under that monetary policy assumption, I see inflation returning to\rtarget, but only very gradually, in 2018.\rI think it would be useful for us to spend more time in our conversations to dig into the\rdifferences in our outlooks for inflation. I thought it was great that some people were offering\rvery specific forecasts that differed from that in Tealbook A, and I thought that was important\rbecause that presumably shapes the differences in our policy outlook as well. Digging into why\rwe have those differences in those inflation outlooks, I think, could be very useful. For me, a\rkey factor underlying my inflation outlook is that improvements in economic activity are\ranticipated to put only modest upward pressure on inflation. So the Phillips curve is relatively\rflat.\rIn my view, this flatness is broadly consistent with the recent behavior of labor markets\rboth in the Ninth District and in the nation. In terms of the Ninth District, in some ways labor\rtalk about some low unemployment. The unemployment rate in the Minneapolis–St. Paul\rmetropolitan area, which has a population of about 3 million, was 3.2 percent in October. The\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r87 of 219\r\runemployment rate in Fargo was 2.2 percent. It’s hardly surprising, with these kinds of\runemployment rates, that we hear widespread reports that firms can’t find desirable workers.\rBut, despite these labor shortages, we continue to hear relatively few reports of wage pressures.\rNow, outside of the oil boom area in western North Dakota, our business contacts\rconsistently report wage growth in 2014 of 2 to 3 percent, although the reports are often closer to\rthe top of that range than they were a couple years ago. These are backward-looking data,\robviously, so if we look forward it might be different. What was most surprising to me, I have to\rsay, is that this general pattern holds true even in Fargo, which I had mentioned earlier has a 2.2\rpercent unemployment rate. Now, many of you, I’m sure, remember your North Dakota\rgeography, but just in case you don’t [laughter], Fargo is on the eastern edge of North Dakota,\rand it’s 400 miles from the heart of the oil boom on the western side of the state. It’s a big state.\rSo this is on the wage-pressure side, and I think one thing we should be trying to drill in\rat and trying to get a better understanding of is how those wage pressures translate into pricing\rpressures. That’s the next step actually, right? Because our goals are shaped in terms of price\rinflation. Our business contacts generally do not see themselves as having much power to raise\rprices. When they talk about wage increases, they say that they will be absorbing those wage\rincreases by reducing margins. In terms of hard evidence, the latest year-over-year CPI increase\rin the Twin Cities was less than 2 percent.\rThis basic story is also playing out in the national economy. We have seen a striking\rimprovement in employment in 2014, and it’s possible to see some signs of compensation\rpressures emerging in the past few quarters. But, by and large, the improvement in the labor\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r88 of 219\r\rrecent national evidence and recent Ninth District evidence are consistent with the flat Phillips\rcurves that underlie the Tealbook’s and my sluggish inflation outlook.\rNow, of course, inflation has already been below target for over 30 months, and, in my\rassessment, this projected long stay—something like seven to eight years below 2 percent—\rcreates substantial risk to the credibility of our target. If I were asked, I, too, would answer as\rseveral Presidents answered before me. I do believe that our expectations remain well anchored.\rMy core fundamental belief is that. I have faith in that. But, I think there is evidence that\rsuggests that there is some risk to that credibility. The continued decline in market-based\rmeasures of longer-term inflation expectations over the intermeeting period suggests that the\rdownside risk to our target may already be materializing.\rAs the Minneapolis staff and I stressed in the memo we sent in the intermeeting period,\rwe think it’s important not to remove these risk premiums when thinking about these marketbased measures. Even if you don’t buy into that story, I think that the decline has to be seen as\rbeing a signal that we’re seeing a decline in longer-term inflation expectations themselves. Of\rcourse, declines in longer-term inflation expectations would spill back and create further\rdownside risks to inflation itself.\rI want to stress that this erosion of credibility scenario is still only a risk to my baseline\routlook, and I wouldn’t necessarily say that it’s a high probability risk. The problem is that the\rexperience in Japan and the more recent experience in Europe both suggest that it would be very\rhard for us to respond effectively to this risk if it were to materialize. The Japanese central bank\ris relying on extensive support from the fiscal authority to be able to respond effectively. I think\rwe should not be building that into our tools about how to respond to that scenario. For that\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r89 of 219\r\rreason it’s a risk that bulks large in my policy thinking, and I’ll say more about that in the next\rgo-round, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Vice Chairman.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Madam Chair. Like many others, I’m more\rconfident about the strength and durability of expansion. There are several reasons for that.\rFirst, the passage of time is important. Many of the headwinds that have blunted the economy’s\rmomentum in recent years have subsided. The most obvious is on the fiscal side. I expect the\rfiscal impulse in 2015 to be slightly positive when one includes both the federal and state and\rlocal government sectors. Another headwind that’s subsiding is credit availability. I think that’s\rcontinuing to improve. Some of this presumably represents the better-capitalized banking\rsystem, but some may also be due to improved confidence by lenders in the economic outlook.\rSecond, in assessing consumption, I think, along with many others, the outlook is quite\rpositive. The real income trend is strengthening, helped by lower energy prices, faster payroll\rgrowth, and higher hours worked. Interesting to me, the New York Fed’s most recent Survey of\rConsumer Expectations, which was released last week, shows a meaningful uptick in household\rone-year-ahead expectations for both nominal earnings growth and nominal household income.\rTranslate that to real, and it’s an even bigger uptick.\rThird, lower oil prices I view as likely to be a substantial positive for global growth. In\rparticular, the lower headline inflation is already provoking a more-aggressive monetary policy\rresponse in Europe and Japan, and, more importantly, the drop in oil prices should lead to a shift\rin the global fiscal stance toward stimulus as oil exporters faced with much lower oil income run\rsmaller surpluses and/or bigger deficits. On the other side, for some oil importers, the drop in\renergy prices represents a very large windfall. This is a huge transfer from oil producers to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r90 of 219\r\rimporters. A $40 drop in the per barrel price of oil represents a transfer of about $1 trillion a\ryear from oil producers to oil importers, which I think is significant.\rIn terms of the inflation outlook, I’m not very worried about the fact that lower oil prices\rare pushing down the headline inflation rate. The effect is likely to be temporary as long as it\rdoesn’t affect wage trends or inflationary expectations, and I would say those conditions are\rbroadly satisfied at this point. With respect to survey measures of inflation expectations, it’s true\rthat the November University of Michigan survey dipped, but we saw a partial retracement of\rthat in the December preliminary results. Moreover, I think the decline that we saw in the\rexpectations. For example, the New York Fed survey shows expectations at both the one-year\rand three-year horizons as having been stable recently.\rI asked my staff, “How should I reconcile the differences between the University of\rMichigan results and the New York Fed survey, and what should I put more weight on?” What\rdo you think the answer was? I don’t think this reflects bias [laughter] in the particular\rmeasurement. I think there’s a pretty strong case to be made that the New York Fed survey is\ractually the superior measure. A few key points worth mentioning. The first point is that the\rUniversity of Michigan inflation expectations survey is much more sensitive to oil and gasoline\rprice developments than the New York Fed survey. This may be due to the fact that the\rUniversity of Michigan survey asks about prices, which brings gasoline prices into people’s\rminds, while the New York Fed survey asks the question in terms of inflation. The second point\ris when oil and gas prices drop, it’s quite common that this actually feeds through to 5-to-10year-forward inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey. In other words, what\rwe’re seeing in terms of the University of Michigan survey right now—a big drop in oil prices\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r91 of 219\r\rand that leading to a drop in 5-to-10-year-forward inflation expectations—is not unusual. It’s\ractually pretty typical, and that means, I think, we should discount it more heavily. The last\rpoint is that there seems to be quite a bit more noise in the University of Michigan survey\rcompared with the New York Fed survey in terms of measurement error. The sample for the\rNew York Fed survey is considerably larger, and, more importantly, it’s panel data. We’re\rasking the same people the same question month after month. I think the New York Fed survey\rappears to be the more reliable measure.\rWith respect to wages, which is sort of the second parameter that might cause you to\rbecome more worried about inflation expectations, the trend doesn’t seem to have changed\rmuch. In particular, there’s no evidence that nominal wage growth is declining. In fact, if you\rlook really closely at the recent ECI and average hourly earnings data, if anything, wage\rcompensation trends may be starting to firm just a little bit. When I look at the survey-based\rmeasures of inflation expectations, when I look at nominal wage growth, both of those series\rsuggest that we should look through the effect of the oil price decline on overall inflation. With\rnominal incomes rising at more than a 4 percent annual rate and the risk of recession very low, it\rseems that the risk of the type of debt deflation dynamic for the United States is very low right\rnow, and that’s very different than the situation in Europe and Japan, in which both inflation and\rnominal income growth are much lower. In fact, when I review the inflation statistics, as I raised\rin the question to the staff earlier, I’m a bit surprised that the core deflator has remained stuck at\r1½ percent. I was actually thinking that it would decline a bit because of the decline in energy\rprices and the appreciation of the dollar.\rNow, in many ways, although we’re wringing our hands and worrying that inflation is\rbelow our target, in some ways it’s actually a good thing. It does allow us to be more patient in\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r92 of 219\r\rterms of the timing of liftoff, and it also should enable us to probe more aggressively to see how\rlow full employment actually is as we go through the monetary policy normalization process. If\rinflation was running at 2.3 percent or 2.4 percent today, we’d be having a very different\rconversation. I think we’re going to want to let the unemployment rate fall slightly below its\rnatural rate in order to push inflation up, and that has a pretty significant benefit. That tight labor\rnot just for them, but good for the country because it would expand the economy’s productive\rcapacity.\rFinally, in terms of risks to the outlook, I think they really seem to lie mostly overseas at\rthis point. One risk we haven’t talked about in any detail is the recent developments in Russia.\rThe ruble has declined precipitously. That’s caused the Russian central bank to raise interest\rrates substantially, and it’s not really clear that they’re in a position that’s going to turn out to be\rsustainable. This, of course, would ripple back mostly to Europe if you think about what the\rnear-term effects would be, through the trade channel and also through their banking system\rexposures. Several large European banks have significant exposure to Russian corporates on the\rorder of 50 percent or more of their core Tier 1 capital.\rI also think the developments in Russia are also concerning from a geopolitical basis. I\rwould think that as the economic circumstances of Russia deteriorate, Vladimir Putin will have\ran incentive to take greater risks geopolitically to divert attention from what’s an increasingly\rproblematic domestic economy.

The economy, particularly the labor market,\rhas made remarkable progress in the past two years, with U-3 having declined from 7.8 percent\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r93 of 219\r\rat the end of 2012 to 5.8 percent at present. This means that the unemployment rate is now\rwithin hailing distance of the most recent estimates of the natural rate of unemployment. Indeed,\rit is tangential to the range that is given by the SEP, which ends at 5.8 percent. We should\rcelebrate this. But, as an aside, we should note that there is a tendency for estimates of the\rnatural rate to adjust adaptively to the actual rate. It tends to come down. This is serious—it\rtends to come down with the actual rates. I’m not sure we’ll stay at 5.8 percent as the natural\rrate. But, in any case, we are much closer than we were until very recently.\rWe are also seeing signs of faster output growth fueled mainly, I suppose, by the two\rforces of very low interest rates and the decline in the price of oil. We are seeing improvements\rin consumer sentiment and growth and investment, which seem to be picking up, aside from\rwhat may happen with regard to oil investment. Earlier speakers have expanded on the growth\rthey are seeing in their Districts and in the data, and I agree with those who believe that the\rrecent trends are more likely to have legs than the earlier false starts, but I will come back to that\rin a minute.\rWell, all of this looks very good, but we have some “buts.” First, investment will be\rreduced by the decline in energy investment. Second, net exports will be reduced by the\rappreciation of the dollar. Third, net exports will be reduced by the slowdown in foreign growth.\rHere I take some encouragement from the fact that the staff forecasts increases in foreign\rgrowth, particularly in Europe, in the coming years, and one really hopes that is right for many\rreasons. I suppose someone will talk about a Greek exit from the European monetary union or a\rsubstantial prolongation of European instability and extremely low, even negative, growth. But\rthe Tealbook does not believe that will happen, and I take some comfort from that.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r94 of 219\r\rFurther, and here Vice Chairman Dudley and I have not spoken previously, we do not\rknow how the volatility in the price of oil and the associated financial market instability will\raffect the world economy, nor do we know what the geopolitical consequences of the unfolding\rRussian economic crisis, which is becoming very difficult for the Russians, will be.\rIn short, although this feels much better, we do have to remind ourselves that two or three\rquarters of good data do not establish a solid trend. We have several times hoped we were\rheading back to 3 percent growth only to have to reduce our forecasts in light of weaker data.\rThat is also to say that we have always to remind ourselves that our forecasts have very wide, not\rnarrow, confidence bands around them.\rDespite the headwinds I have just noted, I am, on balance, also relatively optimistic about\rthe prospects for both the labor markets and overall growth. But there is inflation, and this has\rtwo aspects. First, there is the large impact on the inflation rate of the decline in the price of oil.\rThe Tealbook forecasts that the PCE price index will decline in both this quarter and the next\rquarter. But this energy price effect will be temporary. As the Chair has said, the FOMC has\rlooked through the higher price of oil on several previous occasions, including notably in 2008.\rThe FOMC was right to do that then, and we will be similarly right to look through the lower\rprice of oil now.\rI expect we will all agree that this is the right approach, in particular because the\rextremely low inflation expected in the next year or so is the result of a positive supply shock,\rwhich is growth-inducing, rather than the result of exceptionally low demand, which is the fear\rbehind very low inflation when you are thinking of temporary inflation. The more serious\rinflation problem is to be found in the Tealbook forecast for core inflation for the coming\ryears—2014 and 2015 have core inflation of 1½ percent, which is obviously significantly below\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r95 of 219\r\rour 2 percent target—and the Tealbook predicts that even by 2017 the core inflation rate will be\r1.8 percent and not yet 2 percent.\rWell, how should we think about this core inflation? I have two main reactions. The\rfirst is to point out that 1.8 percent is very close to 2 percent. Using the staff’s baseline\rprediction for inflation, and estimating probabilities using stochastic simulations of the FRB/US\rmodel kindly supplied by the staff, the probability that inflation in 2017 will be greater than\r2 percent is 40 percent, and above 1.8 percent is 48 percent. We are not talking about very\rdifferent outcomes for inflation.\rMy second reaction is to say that while I believe the staff’s views as reflected in the\rTealbook forecast are plausible, there are several possible reasons to expect, nonetheless, that\rnominal wage growth may begin to rise more than predicted in the Tealbook as the level of\runemployment continues to decline. One reason is the basic economics of supply and demand.\rThat is, of course, taken into account in the Tealbook, because there are increases in price\rinflation and nominal wage growth in the Tealbook forecast. But I would add to that a lesson of\rexperience that when one proclaims the end of a well-established relationship, more often than\rnot, that is the moment that the relationship makes its presence known shortly thereafter. I think\rthis may well happen again in the case of the flat Phillips curve.\rLet’s go back to the key question, which is, what should we do? In particular, what\rshould we do if the labor markets continue to strengthen in the months to come, but core\rinflation remains around 1.5 percent? Yes, we have two choices. Some would insist that we not\rbegin normalization until the core inflation rate reaches 2 percent. However, the consensus\rstatement says—I had to mention it here—[laughter]—that in considering how to manage policy,\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r96 of 219\r\rwe must follow a balanced approach with respect to the dual mandate. I’ll expand on that\rtomorrow. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Governor Tarullo.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Madam Chair. I join the general view that has been\rexpressed this afternoon that the steady growth of what is almost now a year’s duration is likely\rto continue. Like President Lacker and a few others here, I found myself looking for reasons to\rbelieve that this time, the relatively strong performance will continue, as opposed to our past\rpattern of a period of sustained decent growth faltering after fiscal or monetary stimulus has been\rremoved. Several of you have mentioned some reasons to believe that. I will just note three\rquickly.\rOne, I just alluded to the fact that, this time around, when we began tapering early this\ryear and through the end of the LSAPs,, we didn’t see the kind of stumbles that occurred earlier\rwhen either fiscal or monetary stimulus was withdrawn, and what had been a promising period\rof an uptick in growth was followed by a disappointing couple of quarters.\rTwo, as Jeff also noted, beyond the continued improvement in the unemployment rate\rand the recent strength of monthly jobs numbers, we are now seeing more structural dynamism\rin labor markets. Following on the increases in job openings, albeit with some lag, the quits rate\rhas been edging up this year. It is now solidly in pre-crisis territory, which is probably notable\rsince each of the past two recessions resulted in the quits rate never quite getting back to where it\rhad been previously. That is some indication of an uptick in dynamism. The hires rate isn’t\rquite there yet, but it has also improved, on net, this year.\rThree, while it is hard to say where the equilibrium point for household debt is or should\rbe, it is pretty clear that a considerable amount of deleveraging has taken place. We are now at\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r97 of 219\r\rlevels of household debt comparable with those prevailing in the early years of the past decade,\rbefore the effect of the mortgage mania had accelerated the growth of household debt. The pace\rof decline in the ratio of household debt to GDP has diminished considerably in the past year or\rso. It is not unreasonable to think that the change in the second derivative will portend some\rleveling off of this ratio in the not-too-distant future, an inference that is buttressed by the fact\rthat the dollar amount of total household debt has risen modestly over the past year. I should\rprobably add that student debt accounts for a fair bit of that increase, and serious delinquency\rrates of student debt have risen quite a bit, now surpassing credit card debt, which was the\rtraditional leader in this category. This is hardly an unalloyed good.\rNow, as Governor Fischer and President Lockhart have already said, and I think Jay may\rsay it as well, it is not as though we have unqualifiedly good news. But I think that what we\rhave seen explains and justifies the prevailing attitude today that, with continued progress for\ranother couple of quarters, concerns about premature liftoff or the inevitable choppiness of the\rfirst rate increase will diminish enough to put a federal funds rate increase in play. On the other\rhand, as Governor Fischer also pointed out, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty that\rremains. On the upside of economic performance, it is possible that we would get unexpectedly\rhigh jobs numbers for the next few months, along with more concrete signs of accelerating wage\rincreases. I’m sure that would lead some to want to consider an earlier liftoff.\rFrom my perspective, there are at least two plausible scenarios that would make me, at\rleast, more hesitant to move in the June–September timeframe that is represented by many of the\rdots of voters in this SEP. One, which has already been mentioned by several people, is the\rexternal downside risk from global markets. It is certainly reasonable to expect, as the Tealbook\rdoes, that the euro zone will improve slightly next year, and that some form of QE there will help\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r98 of 219\r\rstave off any deflationary or recession threat. But the euro zone does lack much capacity to\rabsorb any further shocks, whether from renewed sovereign debt problems or geopolitical\rturmoil or other sources. Were things to go awry in the euro zone and China’s growth to slow\rmore than the current consensus suggests, financial markets, and market psychology more\rgenerally, might pose risks to the United States. I know that most models suggest a limited\rvulnerability to external developments of this sort, but my memory, at least, of past episodes\rsuggests that the models may be missing something, particularly in the absence of either fiscal or\rmonetary stimulus in the United States. I think Governor Brainard, fortunately, probably has a\rbetter perspective on this than I.\rThe other scenario is the one that concerns me perhaps more, and that’s anticipating that\rjobs numbers and other indicators, including unemployment, may suggest, by the first part of\rnext year, continued moderate strengthening of labor markets, but that there also would be\revidence of labor participation increasing, part-time employment diminishing, and still no real\rsigns of wage acceleration, much less upward pressure on inflation. The question would be what\rto do in those circumstances. This returns me to a theme that I’ve sounded, probably ad\rnauseum, over the past year or two here, which is that with all of the uncertainties in labor\rlabor markets over the past couple of years, and we are well advised to be pretty pragmatic and\rpretty data sensitive in thinking about and assessing what is actually going on in labor markets.\rThere are some labor economists who are already beginning to do some work on what\rthey find to be the changes in life-cycle labor market behavior that could conceivably be second\ronly to the broad entry into the labor market of women over a three-decade period in changing\rthe shape of labor market behavior. We don’t know whether that is actually occurring yet, but\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r99 of 219\r\rwe do know that a lot of things that have happened in labor markets—participation rates and\rother things—haven’t conformed to what might have been expected based on pre-crisis behavior.\rThis may be another area in which the crisis and the Great Recession have accelerated trends that\rwere previously a little harder to detect.\rWhen we look at wages and the anticipation of wage increases, even though the NFIB is\rnow predicting more wage increases being paid by its members—we should probably note that\rthey have been predicting that for two years now, and we haven’t yet seen it realized. As I think\rPresidents Kocherlakota and Rosengren have both pointed out, in some discrete analyses that\rtheir staffs did, there is some reason to believe that the performance of labor markets and wage\rGovernor Fischer alluded to the Phillips-curve issue, and that the slope may indeed change or\rrevert to where it has been. But for a while now, the Phillips curve has been pretty flat, and we\rcan’t predict with any certainty that it will normalize, understanding that “normal” may vary\rfrom time to time.\rAgain, this all leads me to the anticipation that if we face this set of circumstances in the\rspring or the early summer, I think it behooves us to think carefully about whether we would be\rprepared to lift off, notwithstanding the fact that there will have been continued economic\rgrowth in that period. I don’t know that that’s where we’ll be. I actually think it’s not so likely\rthat we will have six more months of really solid job numbers and not see some changes in wage\rpatterns and part-time unemployment, but we might, and I think we should just remain open to\rthat.\rWhat we’ve been doing in the past couple of meetings, I think, is trying to begin weaning\rthe markets gradually off what has been something like calendar-based guidance and more\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r100 of 219\r\rtoward a focus on conditions as we see them evolving in the nearer term. I just want us to make\rsure that we don’t replace a calendar approach for holding off rate increases with a calendar\rapproach for starting them and instead really stick to what we all tend to mouth as the mantra—\rthat we want to be reacting to conditions, be state contingent, be conditional, whatever one’s\rfavorite phrase is—and that, I continue to think, will probably serve us best over the next couple\rof quarters. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Governor Powell.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POWELL. Thank you, Madam Chair. My forecast is very close to that of the\rregion of 2½ percent. Consumer spending ought to be strong, supported by much lower energy\rprices, higher levels of confidence, continued low interest rates, and higher stock prices.\rBusinesses should respond by hiring and investing. In the labor market I see continued\rimprovement across a broad range of measures, including strong payroll growth at well over\r200,000 per month, a flattening out of labor force participation at roughly current levels for a\rcouple of years at least, and the elimination of remaining slack. Wages ought to react positively.\rIn fact, we may already be seeing the beginning of that, and I see inflation moving back up to the\r2 percent objective as slack is eliminated.\rThe one place where I differ very modestly from the baseline is in the pace of rate\rincreases. In particular, it seems to me that if we are broadly on the baseline path, we would be\rraising rates more than 25 basis points per quarter in 2016, and that’s what the baseline shows. I\rwould think we would be moving along a little more rapidly than that, but it’s not a huge\rdifference.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r101 of 219\r\rAlso, I would say I take some positive signal from the Reserve Bank inquiries of District\rbusiness contacts. It’s nice to see measures like that coming up all over the place that tend to\rsuggest that the time for wage increases and greater hiring is coming soon.\rI find this narrative, which is broadly that of the Tealbook and the central tendency of the\rupside. I don’t think anyone should fall over dead with surprise if the alternative view on pages\r6 and 7 of Tealbook A, materializes since all it does is represent a straight-lining, in effect, of\r2014. That said, in the spirit of poking holes in this consensus and perhaps the spirit of cautious\rcontrarianism, I think Dennis said, I’m going to mention three gaps or disconnects and also one\remerging risk scenario that I think could threaten the narrative. And I have to admit, I can’t\rdismiss them from my mind, and we’ve talked about these in one form or another.\rThe first is the gap between the relatively strong performance here in the United States\rand the weakness we see in Europe and elsewhere around the world, the threat being that we will\rfeel this weakness over time, perhaps through the stronger dollar or through the risk-off channel\rif the bad events do happen. I see this as the principal threat to the baseline narrative. The\ralternative scenario in Tealbook A, titled “Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar,”\rcaptures that pretty well.\rThe second gap is one we spent some time on today, and that is the gap between survey\rmeasures of inflation expectations, which are stable, and market-based inflation compensation\rbased on TIPS and inflation swaps, which show meaningful declines at the distant horizon. I\rthought that the paper that Yuriy Kitsul shared before the meeting was quite useful, showing that\rinflation compensation between 5 and 10 years out has declined by 72 basis points so far this\ryear—it’s actually more than that now, this is a week-old paper. And different models propose\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r102 of 219\r\rdifferent decompositions of this change, as we’ve discussed. The Board model happens to assign\rthe smallest amount to actual expectations of lower inflation and to inflation risk premiums and\rthe largest amount to liquidity premiums, which is really meant to capture the greater attraction\rof nominals due to their higher liquidity as well as other factors related to supply and demand.\rOther models tend to agree that there’s relatively little to be seen in actual changes in inflation\rexpectations but assign greater increases to the inflation risk premium. Inflation swaps send a\rsimilar signal. I look at all of these, and my instinct is to dismiss them and want to go with the\rsurvey-based measures, but I have to admit they raise concerns. It’s very difficult to convince\roneself that there isn’t something here to at least be concerned about, and it will bear close\rmonitoring.\rThe third gap I will mention is that between the median rate forecast in the SEP and the\rbaseline, on the one hand, and the forecast reflected in market readings, on the other hand—and\rthat gap is now quite large. At the short end, OIS quotes show a rate of about 1½ percent at\ryear-end 2016 compared with about 2½ percent in the SEP. Some of that may reflect a\rdifference between the Committee’s modal outlook and the risk-neutral pricing of OIS, but not\rall of it. At the longer end, if you drop the SEP forecast and pretend it’s a 10-year bond, you get\ra yield to maturity of about 3 percent, but the yield this morning was about 2.07 percent, and the\rdifference is that the Treasury market is pricing in a much lower path of rates. The one-yearforward rate in five years is 2.7 percent, fully 100 basis points below the Committee’s long-run\requilibrium.\rWhy is the market pricing in lower yields than the Committee? Board models attribute\rabout half of that to term premiums and only small amounts to real short rates and expected\rinflation. I guess there are two narratives. One may be that the market is concerned about the\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r103 of 219\r\rpossibility of weaker growth and lower expected inflation. Another explanation is that, given the\rsharp differences in economic performance and expectations for policy, global fixed income\rinvestors would rather own dollar-denominated risk-free instruments at the 10-year tenor\ryielding 2 percent rather than other alternatives like comparable euro-denominated instruments\rthat yield 0.6 percent or even lower-yielding Japanese ones.\rThe recent data tend to support this story. My own sense is that the Treasury market is,\rin fact, pricing in lower oil prices and stronger foreign demand for Treasuries as opposed to\rconcerns about slower U.S. growth or lower inflation. But there is likely some truth in both\rthese explanations. Again, I find it hard to dismiss that.\rthis point, but I think there may be a heightened risk of an emerging markets selloff or even a\rrout driven by declining oil prices, a stronger dollar, and evolving events in Russia. The\rsensitivity of investors to these developments may be tested by the likely acknowledgement in\rtomorrow’s statement that the time for increases in U.S. interest rates may be drawing near.\rIn any case, these three gaps will be adjusted or eliminated over time. I’m not suggesting\rthat that process needs to be destabilizing or destructive, but I do think that they point to risks of\rweaker growth and lower inflation, and perhaps I’m just constitutionally more focused on\ravoiding downside risks, or it may be that the risks to the downside actually are greater and\rrepresent more difficult challenges for policy than the upside risks—for example, the risk that we\rmight get several more payroll reports well in the 300,000 level. I’ll have more to say on that\rtomorrow. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Governor Brainard.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r104 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. BRAINARD. Since we last met, we’ve had two strong payroll reports, and\rAmerican consumers are demonstrating more confidence both in their actions and in their\rexpectations, bolstered, in part, by significantly lower prices at the pump. These are very\rwelcome developments. But we also see the increasingly resilient growth in the United States\rtaking place against a backdrop of considerable risks to the outlook in several important foreign\reconomies, and the dollar has continued its sharp appreciation. In addition, progress in moving\rinflation back up toward our target has been quite limited, even looking through the recent sharp\rdrop in oil prices. On balance, then, I would say that conditions continue to validate our strategy\rof ending asset purchases in October—this time for real, or so we hope—while remaining\rsomewhat patient on the removal of monetary accommodation, even as we see the day of liftoff\rcoming, I think, into clearer view.\rThe news from the labor market has been unambiguously positive. The unemployment\rrate has moved down further. Payroll employment is now averaging above 280,000 per month.\rAnd whereas previously nearly all of the take-up in slack was seen only in the overall\runemployment rate, now we’re seeing other margins of slack also showing improvement. The\rparticipation rate has been about flat since the spring, which is encouraging, given that we think\rthere is an underlying trend of decline, and it suggests some cyclical improvement. The number\rof employees working part time for economic reasons has moved noticeably lower in the past\rthree months after remaining stubbornly high, and it’s also notable that most of the reduction in\runemployment over the past year has been accounted for by a welcome and overdue reduction in\rlong-term unemployment.\rBut, of course, while we see evidence that labor market slack is diminishing across a\rnumber of dimensions, we don’t actually have very good measurements of how much slack\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r105 of 219\r\rremains. Moreover, we see no clear evidence of a broad-based acceleration in wages. We hear a\rlot of anecdotes. There are some regional and skill-specific pressures, but all three of the\rmeasures that we traditionally look at on the aggregate measure of wages show increases from a\ryear ago that are still mired in the 2 to 2¼ percent range, well below increases prior to the crisis\rand little different from the pace in recent years.\rThe incoming data on aggregate spending, I think, reinforce the picture of solid\runderlying growth momentum in the domestic economy. The data on consumer spending\rreceived after publication of the Tealbook suggest that second-half GDP is increasing at above a\r3 percent pace, which is very welcome. The continued low rates and the recent sharp declines in\roil prices should continue to boost consumer spending into the next year, while also, on balance,\rproviding a plus to business investment and output. It’s also significant that potential disruptions\rto the fiscal-policy trajectory, which have damaged incipient recoveries previously, have been\rtaken off the table, which removes a significant source of risk.\rOne note of weakness, I think, on the domestic aggregate demand front is familiar. We\rstill see weakness in single-family housing, and the data that we saw this morning has singlefamily permits, the best gauge of activity in this sector, changing little again.\rNow, on the risk side, I think the inflation picture bears continued vigilance. Even\rlooking through the recent sharp declines in oil prices on the assumption they will stabilize and\rpass through to retail prices over the next two quarters, the level of inflation that might be\rexpected to prevail seems to be centered around 1½ percent, below our target. Although there\rare good reasons to expect inflation to move up toward the target as slack is eliminated, we\rhaven’t seen any sustained movement in that direction thus far. Taken together with the recent\rshift down in market-based indications of inflation expectations, this points to some downside\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r106 of 219\r\rrisks in the inflation outlook, especially given the backdrop of falling commodity prices and\rdisinflationary pressures abroad. We also are seeing some financial risks from the big\radjustments recently in the price of oil, and they bear watching, I think.\rIt’s also important to recognize possible risks from a further deterioration in economic\rconditions abroad. The intermeeting period saw further evidence of stagnation or weakening in\reconomic activity in some of the largest foreign economies, further monetary accommodation or\rexpectations of future easing in response, and a further notable increase in the dollar. Realized\rand expected changes in foreign monetary policy arise in the context of continued\runderperformance in key foreign economies struggling with deflationary pressures, compounded\rin some cases by an unwillingness or inability to engage in meaningful fiscal support to domestic\rdemand and ongoing and unresolved structural challenges. Recent events in Greece remind us\rthat although there has been notable progress, threats to financial stability in the euro area\rremain.\rAlthough the United States obviously has a very large and diversified internal market,\rthis doesn’t imply that we are in any way a closed economy or immune from foreign shocks.\rConnections between the United States and foreign markets are still extremely large in both\rdirections, and recent experience tells us that financial market disturbances abroad can have very\rlarge effects on U.S. asset prices and on financial markets more generally.\rDue to the lag in the dollar’s effects on trade, net exports will likely continue to subtract\rfrom GDP growth over the medium term. Moreover, I suspect that increases in the value of the\rdollar have not yet run their course. Staff memos have noted that, on net, the effect of dollar\rappreciation on U.S. GDP growth can be expected to be relatively modest, but this net effect\rconceals two important and significant gross effects, an initial and substantial depressing effect\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r107 of 219\r\rof dollar increases on net exports and a subsequent, partially offsetting positive effect from a\rmore-accommodative monetary policy. If a strengthening dollar does weigh heavily on net\rexports, all else being equal, we will need to adjust the pace of normalization in response.\rThe good news is that the U.S. economy and financial system have become more resilient\rover the past two years, and internal sources of demand seem sufficiently strong, particularly\rwith the boost from low gas prices, to continue growth momentum in the face of headwinds from\rabroad. But I would not lightly dismiss risks that those headwinds could intensify.\rOverall, when considering appropriate policy, I would place robust domestic demand\rgrowth in the context of a global environment of weak foreign aggregate demand and large\rpersistent disinflationary pressures. Such an environment, in my view, suggests that downside\rrisks to U.S. growth remain, and, coupled with persistently weak core inflation below our target\rand some deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, it warrants a still cautious approach\rto policy normalization. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you very much. Let me thank everyone for a very thoughtful\rround of observations on the economic outlook. I think this has been an unusually rich\rdiscussion. I’m not going to be able to do it justice. I have a couple of comments of my own,\rbut before I share those, I’ll try as I usually do to summarize the main themes in your economic\rremarks, taking note particularly of how they bear on your assessment of progress we have seen\rtoward closing the employment and inflation gaps and the question of whether incoming\revidence suggests some meaningful change in the likely pace of future progress.\rStarting with the labor market, I think everybody agreed that conditions have continued\rto improve, and the degree of underutilization of labor resources is diminishing. Several of you\rnoted that the employment reports we received since our October meeting suggest faster progress\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r108 of 219\r\rthan you had expected. Up until last spring, payroll gains were averaging around 200,000 per\rmonth. By April, that three-month moving average had ramped up to around 240,000, and now\rthe three-month average is running at almost 280,000. Even if the pace of job gains were to step\rdown in line with the Tealbook projection, employment growth would still be on solid footing.\rThe unemployment rate declined only 0.1 percentage point over the past two months, but labor\rforce participation is up 0.1 percentage point and the employment-to-population ratio is up 0.2\rpercentage point since our October meeting. The share of the labor force working part time for\reconomic reasons remains quite high, but it, too, has continued to edge down. It has declined 0.1\rpercentage point per month for the past four months.\rA number of you pointed out that the JOLTS data also paint a more encouraging picture\rof the labor market. Job openings have flattened out at a pace slightly above their pre-recession\rlevel after rising strongly earlier in the year, and hires and quits have both moved up over the\rpast two months and are now close to pre-recession levels. There continue to be reports, of\rcourse, of wage pressures in specific geographic areas and sectors. Now we’re even seeing signs\rhere and there of a possible incipient pickup in wage growth in aggregate data. For example,\rthere was a bump up in average hourly earnings in November, and the ECI measures of\rcompensation and wage and salary growth have also been rising more rapidly than earlier in the\ryear.\rBut in terms of longer-term trends, wage gains still look pretty tepid. On a 12-month\rbasis, average hourly earnings have barely edged above 2 percent, and, over the past year, the\rwages and salaries component of the ECI has risen by a similarly modest amount. President\rRosengren noted work that his staff is doing as well, looking at the wages earned by new hires\rand the fact that that measure doesn’t yet show any meaningful pickup in wages. We continue to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r109 of 219\r\rdiscuss our diverse views on whether U-3 is an adequate summary statistic of where the labor\rpossible stance on policy, I think everyone around the table agrees that the labor market has\rimproved, and it looks likely to continue to do so.\rOf course, the outlook for the labor market depends on economic growth, and I heard\rmost of you express reasonable confidence that, even with the downside risks we’re seeing for\rthe global growth outlook, that you expect growth to be at least adequate to sustain continued\rimprovement in the labor market over coming months. A number of you noted that despite\rslightly softer growth abroad in the third quarter, U.S. growth looks like it’s running near 3½\rpercent in the second half of the year, and that’s above our expectations at the time of the\rLooking at your SEP submissions and some of your comments, the growth outlook\rbeyond this year hasn’t actually changed much since September, but most of you are anticipating\rabove-trend growth. We’ve been disappointed before, and President Lockhart and others remind\rus that we should be careful not to become overconfident, but I did hear a good deal of upbeat\rsentiment around the table that you think the economy really is exhibiting greater momentum.\rYou feel increased confidence that next year will be a year in which we do see a faster pace of\rgrowth, and that the expansion seems to be on track.\rThe continued decline in oil prices since our October meeting is one of the most notable\reconomic developments shaping the outlook. Many of you noted that the spending stimulus due\rto lower energy prices does provide an offset to the restraint from the stronger dollar, and\rconsumers, especially low-income consumers, should benefit from the decline in energy prices.\rWe had an interesting discussion about the likely impact of lower energy prices on North\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r110 of 219\r\rAmerican drilling activity and capital spending, and that’s something that will bear close\rwatching. But I think all of you agreed that, on balance, the net effect of the decline in oil prices\rfor U.S. GDP growth is positive—at least of the magnitude of decline we’ve seen so far.\rHowever, some of you noted the effect that the decline in oil prices will have on the global\reconomy. Even though one can make the case that the net effect is positive, there really are very\rdifferent regional effects, taking account of the possibility in Europe of pushing inflation\rexpectations down and financial market effects. This is something that’s going to bear close\rwatching and is a risk.\rWith respect to the U.S. outlook, a number of you also pointed to increased consumer\rconfidence and expressed your belief that a good dynamic, a kind of self-reinforcing multiplieraccelerator type of positive dynamic, may finally be coming into play.\rTurning to inflation, incoming data during the intermeeting period have been mixed.\rTealbook revised up its estimate of core PCE inflation in the current quarter after seeing\rthis assessment. On the other hand, though, the drag from declining energy prices on headline\rinflation now looks like it will be larger than previously projected, with the 12-month rate likely\rto drop below 1 percent early next year. Moreover, several of you pointed to downward pressure\ron inflation from dollar appreciation, which likely will lower non-energy commodity and\rimported goods prices.\rOn the question of whether lower energy prices and the higher dollar will leave an\rimprint on inflation beyond the next couple of quarters, I heard mixed views. A number of you\rexpressed confidence in your projection that inflation will likely move back to 2 percent over\rtime in an environment of continued improvement in the labor market. A number of you pointed\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r111 of 219\r\rout that, with respect to inflation expectations, survey-based measures have remained stable and\rsuggest that long-run inflation expectations are well anchored. And we’ve had a very rich\rdiscussion that I’m not even going to try to summarize regarding how to interpret the decline\rwe’ve seen in five-year, five-year-forward breakevens that have continued to decline further\rsince our October meeting. The staff’s financial Board briefing yesterday pointed out that there\rare an awful lot of different ways to break this down into inflation expectations, inflation risk\rpremiums, and liquidity effects, and the breakdown that one gets is actually highly model\rsensitive. I think this is something, obviously, to which we’re going to be paying close attention\ras we go forward.\rAll in all, while most of you see the drop in headline inflation as largely transitory and\rcontinue to expect that it will move gradually back toward 2 percent, some of you are concerned\rthat we may be seeing the beginning of a worrisome downward adjustment in inflation\rexpectations. If inflation expectations were to shift down markedly, this would create downside\rrisks to inflation itself, and a failure on our part to take decisive action could exacerbate this risk\rby diminishing the credibility of our commitment to our 2 percent inflation objective. Clearly,\rinflation developments will bear close watching.\rLet me stop there and see if anyone would like to comment on this summary. [No\rresponse] Okay. Then let me just add a few brief comments of my own. First, I want to join\rwith the others who described incoming news pertaining to the labor market as encouraging. My\rown reaction to incoming data, including the two employment reports, is that we are seeing a\rpattern of across-the-board improvement in labor market conditions. Virtually every indicator I\rmonitor shows movement in the right direction. For example, I consider the quits rate a very\ruseful cyclical indicator, and I’m encouraged by the increase we have seen in the past couple of\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r112 of 219\r\rreports. A substantial share of quits results from job offers that employed workers receive and\raccept, and an increase in the prevalence of such offers points to the possibility of more-rapid\rwage increases and, I think, suggests real improvement in the labor market.\rTo the extent that there are also people who quit into unemployment, an increase in these\rflows suggests that workers have become less wary about leaving one job without having lined\rup the next. I’m similarly encouraged by the more favorable assessments of the labor market\rwe’re seeing in household surveys. If you will forgive me for returning yet again to my crosscountry road trip analogy [laughter], whereas in October my assessment was that we were just\rpulling into Cleveland, by now I think we’ve left President Mester’s office. We’re in the process\rof crossing the Allegheny Mountains. There remains some way to go to the Weehawkin end of\rthe Lincoln Tunnel, but I’m feeling a lot more hopeful now that we’ll make it all the way to\rManhattan without hitting any major delay.\rLet me turn to inflation. Due to the recent momentum we have seen in the labor market,\rcoupled with the downward pressure we are seeing on inflation, it now seems likely that the\reconomy will return to maximum employment before inflation is returned to our 2 percent\robjective. Assuming that the labor market continues to improve, a key policy question for us\rwill be how inflation developments should bear on our decision concerning the timing of liftoff.\rWe included a new question in the SEP to help gain some insight into your thinking on\rthis topic, and I appreciate your willingness to provide more detailed information concerning\ryour views both on the appropriate timing of liftoff and the economic conditions you expect to\rprevail at that time. It appears from your responses that most of you anticipate that liftoff will\rbecome appropriate during the first three quarters of next year. Many of you report that you\rexpect core inflation will be running about 1½ percent or just a tad higher, while headline\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r113 of 219\r\rinflation will be running under or only slightly above 1 percent. At the point that you see liftoff\ras appropriate, it therefore appears that most of you do not expect to have discernable evidence\rin hand that would confirm that inflation is actually moving back up to 2 percent.\rLet me say that, like most of you, I also anticipate liftoff under conditions like these, but\rfor me to support a decision to lift off with core inflation in the neighborhood of 1½ percent and\rheadline inflation significantly lower, I will need to feel reasonably confident that inflation will\ractually begin moving back up to 2 percent over the next couple of years. To make such a\rforecast, I will be relying on theory, consistent with historical evidence, that with well-anchored\rinflation expectations, inflation will move up as the output gap shrinks and commodity prices\rstabilize. Incoming evidence confirming that inflation expectations remain well anchored, that\renergy and commodity prices are stabilizing, and that resource slack will continue to erode,\rpossibly even with some small overshoot in the labor market, would bolster my confidence that\rinflation will, in fact, head back toward our 2 percent longer-run objective, in line with my SEP\rsubmission.\rI admit this is a forecast-based approach to tightening, but I’m comfortable with this\rapproach because, given the lags in monetary policy, I think we have to base our decisions on\rwhere we think inflation and real activity are heading and not where they are. That said, if\runfolding developments were to materially diminish my confidence in this inflation outlook,\rthen I probably would want to be more cautious about removing accommodation. In this regard,\rthere are a few things I will be watching closely. One is wage developments. For example, as\rseveral of you mentioned, we may be seeing some tentative signs—and I’d underline\r“tentative”—that nominal wage growth may be stepping up. Even though I recognize that the\rlink between nominal wage growth and consumer price inflation is pretty weak, if a sustained\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r114 of 219\r\rstep-up in nominal wage growth were to emerge, this would suggest that we’re moving closer to\rour full employment objective, and it would enhance my confidence that PCE inflation would\rmove back to 2 percent. Conversely, if nominal wage growth fails to step up at all while core\rPCE inflation was, for example, to move yet lower, I would be more cautious about lifting off.\rSimilarly, for now I consider the jury to be out on whether recent movements in TIPS\rbreakevens reflect some broad-based reduction in confidence in our willingness and ability to\rachieve our 2 percent inflation objective or whether they instead reflect the transitory influence\rof recent oil price declines and possibly financial market spillovers from European inflation\rdevelopments. But should we see further declines in measures of inflation expectations after oil\rprices have leveled off, this, too, would give me pause.\rWith respect to the decline in inflation compensation and financial market developments\rmore generally, I would note that a possible interpretation both of the move down in inflation\rcompensation and also the sizable gap between our SEP paths for the federal funds rate and the\rpath implied by market prices is that market participants believe that the equilibrium real interest\rrate has declined. Such a decline would imply a higher likelihood of periods when nominal rates\rwill be at the zero lower bound and inflation will be below target. If inflation is expected to be\rnear 2 percent during normal times but below 2 percent during zero-lower-bound periods and the\rodds of zero-lower-bound episodes are increased, we would expect to see inflation compensation\rdrift down. I think this interpretation is perhaps in line with President Kocherlakota’s memo to\rus on this topic. In this regard, I found the Tealbook analysis pertaining to the cost of insurance\ragainst inflation outcomes quite interesting. It suggests that the cost of insuring against high\rinflation outcomes has moved down while the cost of insuring against low inflation outcomes\rhas moved up, consistent with the decline in the equilibrium real rate.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r115 of 219\r\rIn summary, I don’t think there’s a simple clear-cut answer to the question of whether\rinflation near current levels would or would not be consistent with liftoff being appropriate. For\rme, the answer will depend on both the outlook for inflation at the time and our confidence in the\rprojection. I think the current language in paragraph 3 of alternative B is, therefore,\rappropriately open ended on this question.\rLet me stop there. I think before dinner it would be good if we could ask Bill to provide\rhis briefing on the policy round, and then we’ll resume with that tomorrow morning.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. 5 Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be referring to the exhibits\rlabeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” We made small\rchanges to the final sentence of the first paragraph of all three alternatives that are\rshown in blue to take account of the rebound in the Michigan survey measure of\rlonger-run inflation expectations that we received on Friday.\rThe top two panels on the first page of the handout provide information on labor\roverall unemployment rate has edged down in recent months, while the broader\rU-6 measure, line 2, has moved down more noticeably. Gains in payroll\remployment, line 3, have picked up of late. Your SEP submissions for the\runemployment rate suggest that you anticipate underutilization of labor resources to\rcontinue to diminish over coming quarters.\rAs shown in the table to the right, you generally see the recent drop in energy\rprices holding total PCE inflation somewhat below the core rate in 2015, but, by\r2016, the central tendency of your projections for total PCE inflation moves back in\rline with the core rate.\rThe middle-left panel plots your projections of unemployment rate gaps and fourquarter inflation at the time of liftoff. Like Beth, I am showing core rather than\rheadline inflation in order to abstract from the temporary effects of changes in energy\rprices. Most of you expect the actual unemployment rate to be within three-tenths of\ra percentage point of your estimate of its longer-run normal level and the four-quarter\rchange in core PCE prices to be between 1.5 and 1.7 percent. By these two metrics,\rat least, you appear to have a reasonable consensus on the economic conditions you\ranticipate at the time that the first increase in the federal funds rate becomes\rappropriate. That said, your expectations for the calendar date of liftoff span the\rperiod from 2015:Q1 to 2016:Q4.\r\r5\r\rThe materials used by Mr. English are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r116 of 219\r\rAs shown by the lines in the middle-right panel, the median path for the federal\rfunds rate from the dealer survey has changed little since the time of the September\rmeeting. By contrast, the median federal funds rate in the SEP, indicated by the dots,\rhas moved down somewhat.\rThe bottom panel highlights a number of considerations relevant for updating the\rforward guidance regarding liftoff. First, the responses from the Desk’s survey assign\rroughly even odds to a change in the forward guidance at this meeting but also attach\ra significant probability to a change in March. Many respondents expect the\r“considerable time” language to be replaced with more data-dependent language or\rwith less calendar-specific language, such as “patient.” Second, concerning how the\rstatement may evolve over time and along different paths for the economy, the new\rstatement in alternative B that indicates that the Committee “can be patient in\rbeginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy” could be retained until the\rmeeting at which the Committee judges that liftoff is drawing close. Third,\ralternative B is consistent with the October statement, although the anchoring of\r“considerable time” to the end of purchases in October may come as a surprise to\rsome investors. Finally, at the end of 2016, you generally see the inflation rate near\r2 percent and the unemployment rate near your assessments of its longer-run normal\rlevel, while most of you have the federal funds rate still noticeably below its longerrun value. These projections continue to support the post-liftoff forward guidance\rincluded in recent statements.\rTurning to the alternatives for this meeting, you may view recent economic\rdevelopments and the outlook as broadly in line with your earlier expectations. If so,\ryou may view the updates to the language in alternative B, on page 6, as appropriate.\rIn light of the recent strong employment gains and improvement in the broad\rmeasures of labor utilization, paragraph 1 offers a positive assessment of the labor\rdropping “somewhat,” and then indicating that “underutilization of labor resources\rcontinues to diminish.” Alternative B continues to state that inflation is running\r“below the Committee’s longer-run objective” but notes that this partly reflects\r“declines in energy prices.” It acknowledges that market-based measures of longerterm inflation compensation have declined “somewhat further” but states that surveybased measures “have remained stable.”\rConsistent with your SEP submissions, paragraph 2 of alternative B continues to\rreport that the Committee expects “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace,\rwith labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent\rwith its dual mandate,” and “sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and\rthe labor market as nearly balanced.” The language on the outlook for inflation is\rrevised to more clearly state—along the lines of your SEP submissions—that\rinflation is expected “to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves\rfurther and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.”\rHowever, it adds a note of caution that “the Committee continues to monitor inflation\rdevelopments closely.”\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r117 of 219\r\rWith regard to the forward guidance in paragraph 3, alternative B provides new\rlanguage stating that “based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it\rcan be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.” In order to\rindicate that the Committee is not signaling a change in its policy intentions, the new\rlanguage is accompanied by a sentence indicating that the new guidance is consistent\rwith the “previous statement that it will likely be appropriate to maintain the 0 to\r¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the\rend of [the] asset purchase program in October.” Finally, the post-liftoff guidance in\rparagraph 5 of alternative B is unchanged.\rThe changes to the statement language in alternative B may not surprise many\rand old language concerning liftoff, by tying the “considerable time” to the end of the\rpurchase program in October, may cause expectations for the timing of liftoff to\rbecome more concentrated in the second quarter of 2015. Of course, investors’\rresponses to the statement are difficult to predict with confidence and will depend\rimportantly on the release of information from the December Summary of Economic\rProjections and also on the postmeeting press conference.\rAlternative C, page 8, presents a more positive and confident assessment of the\rrecent economic developments and the outlook. Most important, paragraph 2 states\rthat the Committee “sees sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to\rsupport attainment of its employment objective” and indicates that the risks to\rinflation, as well as to economic activity and the labor market, are “nearly balanced.”\rIt does not refer to monitoring inflation developments closely.\rAlternative C offers two options for replacing the “considerable time” language:\rThe first, paragraph C.3, simply states that the Committee anticipates retaining the\rcurrent target range for the federal funds rate for “some time.” The second, paragraph\rC.3ʹ, would say that “economic conditions will soon warrant an increase in the target\rrange for the federal funds rate.” Paragraph C.4 would modify the current post-liftoff\rguidance by indicating that a target federal funds rate below longer-run normal levels\rrather than after that time.\rFinally, alternative C includes a shorter discussion of reinvestment than the other\rtwo alternatives, and the reference is moved to the end of the statement, reducing the\remphasis on that policy decision.\rA statement like that in alternative C, particularly the guidance in C.3ʹ signaling\rimminent liftoff and the revision to C.4 weakening the post-liftoff guidance, would\rsurprise market participants. Medium- and longer-term interest rates would likely\rrise, inflation compensation and equity prices fall, and the dollar appreciate.\rAlternative A, on page 4, expresses somewhat less confidence about recent\rdevelopments and the economic outlook. Paragraph 1 doesn’t note the recent\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r118 of 219\r\rstronger labor market data, and paragraph 2 indicates that the Committee continues to\rclosely monitor both inflation and inflation expectations.\rAlternative A offers two options for forward guidance: Paragraph A.3 retains the\r“considerable time” phrase but without anchoring that phrase to the end of asset\rpurchases. As a second option, paragraph A.3ʹ states that the Committee will be\rpatient—perhaps “highly” patient—in beginning to normalize the stance of policy “in\rorder to ensure that inflation returns to the 2 percent objective at an appropriately\rrapid pace.” It includes the possibility of indicating that the Committee intends “to\rreverse recent declines in longer-term inflation expectations.”\rA statement like that in alternative A would likely cause market participants to\rpush further into the future their expectation for the timing of the first increase in the\rtarget range for the federal funds rate and might flatten the expected subsequent path\rof policy firming. Accordingly, medium- and longer-term real interest rates would\rprobably decline, inflation compensation and equity prices might rise, and the dollar\rcould depreciate.\rA draft directive for all three alternatives is shown on page 11 of your handout.\rThank you. That completes my prepared remarks. I realize I’m the last thing\rstanding between you and your reception, but I’d be happy to take your questions.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. President Fisher.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. Actually, I’m the last person between you and the reception. [Laughter]\rBill, you said that alternative B is consistent with our old guidance, although the anchoring could\rsurprise some investors. Then you mentioned that the anchoring is dating the term “considerable\rtime” from October, and you said that including it may cause markets to be more concentrated\ron the second quarter.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. Yes.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. I guess my question is, if we just said what we have in red here, “based on\rits current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the\rstance of monetary policy,” and left out the reference to October, then said “especially if\rprojected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal,” so you\rtook out that small section, which you’ve highlighted, would that lead the market to rule out that\rwe wouldn’t be flexible in deciding to move in the second quarter or later?\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r119 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ENGLISH. I’m not sure. I mean, we thought it was helpful to have the sentence\rsaying that the Committee is not intending this to be a change in its forward guidance. I think\rthe question is, what did people understand the forward guidance to be in October? I think that\rsome in the markets think that that was basically “considerable time,” and they’re expecting a\rrepetition of “considerable time.” So by saying “considerable time following the end of its\rpurchase program in October,” you’re pulling a little closer in time the point at which it may be\rappropriate to raise rates. I think that’s consistent with the new “patient” wording, which I think\rmeans something like “not the next couple of meetings,” but it’s not pushing all the way out\ras meaning.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

I’d like to start by asking David\rWilcox to update us on the CPI read this morning.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILCOX. 6 Thank you, Madam Chair. This morning’s release was a little\rweaker than we had been looking for. Our forecast for energy prices was close to\rwhat was published, with about a 3¾ percent decline in energy prices in November.\rAnd, with food, we were pretty close as well. For core CPI, we had been looking for\ran increase of 0.2 and got 0.1 percent.\rNow, we have done a preliminary translation of the CPI prices into PCE terms,\rand there we think we’re going to be down a little more than 0.1 percent from our\rexpectation in the Tealbook that we published last week. A preliminary look at how\rthat’ll play out for the quarterly arithmetic is that, for core PCE inflation at an annual\rrate, we had been expecting 1.6 percent in Q4, and we think that today’s release will\rtake us down to about 1.3 percent. So we’ll be down about 0.3 on the quarter.\rFor quarterly arithmetic reasons, our projection for Q1 would come down a\rcouple of tenths, from 1.5 percent to about 1.3 percent. So, a revised projection, as of\rthis morning, is that we’d have two quarters of core inflation at 1.3 percent on the\rPCE basis.\rFor top line, we had been looking for a Q4 figure of minus 0.1 in the Tealbook,\rand we think that’ll be down to about minus 0.3 or minus 0.4 in Q4. And for top-line\rPCE inflation in Q1, we’d been looking for a decline in the Tealbook of minus 0.6.\rWe think that’ll be down to about minus 0.7—so just one-tenth of 1 percentage point\rerosion in Q1.\rThose are pretty preliminary figures, as you can imagine. Heartbeats were going\rquickly upstairs to get even this much produced.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Any questions? Governor Fischer.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. David, the thing that made a big impression on me was the two quarters\rof negative PCE inflation in the forecast. Does that still remain?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILCOX. Yes.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. And does it extend any further?\r\r6\r\rThe materials used by Mr. Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 6).\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r121 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILCOX. No. As we mentioned, those are predominantly reflecting the steep\ramazing at this point. They are now at something like minus 27 percent at an annual rate in Q4\rand somewhere in the range of minus 35 to minus 40 percent at an annual rate in Q1. So that’s\rwhat’s generating the negative top-line PCE figures for Q4 and Q1 in our projection.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. It’s minus 27 percent times what? What’s the weight in the index?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILCOX. Let’s see whether I have weights here. In the CPI, the energy index gets\ra weight of about 10 percent or so, and, in the PCE, it gets a weight of 5½ percent.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. I guess there’s no one around old enough to remember what happened\rin 1986, when oil prices reached $6 a barrel, at which rate they collapsed.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISHER. I remember that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. Oh, yes—you would.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. I’ll have to remember.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. TARULLO.

We also had the run-up, though, as you remember—because Bob\rHormats and I used to front the U.S.-Saudi oil commission starting in the Carter\rAdministration—and that was a reaction to the run-up in oil prices. They overshot on the upside\rand came dramatically down. I don’t remember how we handled it from a monetary policy\rstandpoint. On that, I would defer to the Chair. The point is that this is not unprecedented, and\rthis isn’t as radical a price movement as we saw back then.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r122 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. Well, I think I’ve said it before in this forum—that many Russian\reconomists attribute the collapse of the Soviet Union to that price and not to the difficulty of\rrunning the system.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

A second collapse.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Are there any further questions for David? [No response] If not,\rthen let me just start off this morning. First of all, I want to thank you for the comments and\rsuggestions you’ve provided on our draft policy statements in the run-up to this meeting. As has\rbeen evident from our ongoing interactions, we have a range of views on how our forward\rguidance should be cast, and I appreciate everyone’s willingness to work together to find some\rcommon ground and to communicate our policy intentions to the public as clearly as possible.\rI’m hopeful that the language we have before us today in alternative B, if we choose to\radopt it, will enhance our flexibility and simplify our communications as we move closer toward\rpolicy normalization. By indicating that the new “patient” language is consistent with the\rprevious “considerable time” language, alternative B also signals continuity in our approach to\rpolicy. Looking ahead, in our January statement, we can drop the phrase “considerable time\rfollowing the end of its asset purchase program in October” and retain the “patient” language\runtil we get closer to liftoff.\rTo further improve our policy communications, I believe it would be useful if I could try\rto clarify some aspects of our thinking during the press conference, but only with your broad\rassent. In this regard, I would appreciate your views on two specific questions during the goround. The first question is how to describe what we mean by the word “patient.” This will be\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r123 of 219\r\ran obvious question in the press conference and one that, frankly, deserves an answer. My\rinclination would be to characterize “patient” by stating something like this: “Based on its\rcurrent outlook, the Committee judges it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least\rthe next couple of meetings.” I would immediately follow that by reiterating that this\rexpectation is entirely data dependent, and if progress proves faster than we expect, we likely\rwould move earlier than now anticipated. In this sense, no meeting is off the table. That said,\runless there is a surprise, this definition does mean that January and March are unlikely. April\rand later meetings are completely live possibilities. So let me emphasize that the absence of a\rpress conference does not, in my view, take April off the table, and I will emphasize this in the\rpress conference if I’m asked about it. If the Committee wants to begin normalizing policy in\rsomething that would also be webcast, and it would occur at 2:30 p.m., the normal time for a\rpress conference following the 2:00 release of our statement.\rThe second question is whether you would be comfortable with my characterizing\rparticipants’ views on the likely timing of liftoff and the economic conditions that are expected\rto prevail at that time. Based on your responses in the SEP, I could say, “Assuming that the\reconomy evolves broadly in line with participants’ expectations, almost all participants believe\rthat it will be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015.\rThere are a range of views on the appropriate timing of liftoff within the year, in part reflecting\rdifferences in participants’ expectations for how the economy will evolve. At the time of liftoff,\rparticipants expect to see some further decline in the unemployment rate and improvement in\rlabor market conditions. They expect core inflation to be running near current levels, but they\rwill want to be reasonably confident in their forecast that inflation will move back toward our\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r124 of 219\r\r2 percent longer-run objective over time.” And, again, I would clearly frame this in the context\rof our expectations being completely data dependent.\rLet me conclude by saying that I don’t think that we will be well served by being overly\rvague on the likely course of policy, particularly if we want to guard against abrupt market\rmoves today and down the road. But we obviously cannot deliver too much precision, as our\rpolicy does depend entirely on how the economy evolves. So let me stop there, and, with that, I\rlook forward to hearing your views. Let me first call on President Lockhart to begin our goround.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Madam Chair. I expect the consensus of the Committee\rto settle on removal of the “considerable time” phrase as in alternative B, and I’m prepared in the\rend to support alternative B, but with some apprehension.\rI want to pick up where I left off in the economy round and express some cautionary\rconcerns. I think we are well advised to be as realistic as we can about the data we’ll have in\rhand and the conditions that could prevail at the time when we might begin to signal imminent\rliftoff, perhaps in the spring. As I argued in the economy round, we may have at least a couple\rof indications in the data to look through, particularly in the inflation data. I don’t feel we\rabsolutely need to make the changes captured in alternative B at this meeting. I’m sympathetic\rto the approach of retaining “considerable time” for one or two more meetings without its link to\rthe ending of asset purchases in October. This is, in effect, the treatment of “considerable time”\rin alternative A, and I could support inserting that into alternative B.\rBecause, in my view, the “considerable time” phrase is widely equated with about six\rmonths, its last use in October—with its connection in that statement to the October QE end—\rmight suggest that we’re signaling an April liftoff. Then, because there’s no press conference\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r125 of 219\r\rscheduled for April, market expectations as of now seem to have centered on June. I would\rprefer not to lock in June and would hope that the Chair’s communication would not inalterably\rfix the market’s focus on June. I think the message of data dependency has to be forceful\renough to allow for adjustment based on our reading of the status and evolution of economic\rcircumstances.\rMy preferred signaling regarding liftoff—conditioned, of course, on supportive data—is\rliftoff at midyear or a little later. I think alternative B at this meeting, with its introduction of the\rnew “patient” theme, could be interpreted as slightly hawkish and could bring some near-term\rtightening. At the long end of the curve, that will probably do no harm. I expect some market\rparticipants to interpret the word “patient” by reference to the pattern of 2004. Market\rparticipants don’t have anything else to go on, so they could take “patient” to signal March or\rIf the Committee decides to go with alternative B, I would urge that the Chair be given\rpermission to convey some strong points explaining the decision in the press conference. I\rsupport Chair Yellen’s request that she downplay any likelihood that the liftoff decision would\rcome in January or March. I also support her request to characterize the mainstream views of the\rCommittee members and participants regarding economic conditions at liftoff. I think this serves\rto stress the economic conditionality associated with the message of data dependency. The Chair\rshould convey that “patient” is not meant to signal a date or time frame. It’s also time to explain\rthat every meeting is in play, and that the Chair will call a press conference when needed. Thank\ryou, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Williams.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r126 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLIAMS. Thank you, Madam Chair. I support alternative B, although I have\rsome comments regarding the wording of the statement that I’ll turn to in a minute.\rThe recovery has picked up a great amount of steam. Of course, inflation remains low,\rbut, with remaining slack diminishing and commodity import prices likely stabilizing, I see\rinflation gradually returning to our objective. The statement appropriately recognizes these\rdevelopments and provides a smooth transition in preparation for liftoff sometime next year. I\rcontinue, personally, to view a June 2015 liftoff as appropriate, but, of course, that’s entirely data\rdependent.\rThe healthy tenor of recent economic data and business reports bolsters my confidence in\rthe ongoing expansion. Performance in the labor market has been especially impressive, and,\rafter a long seven years in the wilderness, we’re probably only about a year away from finally\rreaching our goal of maximum employment.\rTo be consistent with the unvarnished improvement in these labor market data,\rparagraph 1 of alternative B should omit the bracketed “somewhat,” in my view. Including\r“somewhat” would be inconsistent with the very positive October–November labor market\rreports and other labor market indicators, as we discussed yesterday.\rOf course, a consequential change in statement language is the “patient” wording in\rparagraph 3, as President Lockhart mentioned, and my comments are actually going to follow\rvery closely with the comments of President Lockhart. The staff memo did lay out, I think\rnicely, how the statement could evolve from the word “patient” into the future. I will mention\rthat we’ve had two other staff memos over the past several months that explained how\r“considerable time” could very nicely play out through the future to “some time” and how\r“considerable time since October” could play out into the future very nicely. I actually think all\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r127 of 219\r\rof these approaches represent reasonable bridges between now and liftoff, whenever that’s\rappropriate.\rThe main goal that we’re trying to achieve is basically not, in my view, to move market\rexpectations around. Market expectations are pretty reasonable about liftoff right now. Our goal\ris basically to explain in a smooth and easy-to-understand way that we are moving closer to\rliftoff. There are different ways to do that, and my main comments are that I’m more concerned\rabout the word “patient” than maybe I was about “considerable time.” So let me explain my\rconcerns around the word “patient.” And I beg the Committee’s patience in listening to my\rconcerns. I will make a promise here: I will leave time for everyone to finish their holiday\rshopping.\rThere’s always a risk of misinterpretation when we change words or when we add a word\rto the statement or subtract something, and that’s just part of life. But I do think that the word\r“patient” does bring up a couple of issues. Specifically, my concern about the word “patient”\rboils down to: I myself didn’t really know what it meant in terms of monetary policy. And I’m\rgoing to get back to the Chair’s suggestion because I think that’s an important element of our\rcommunications strategy.\rThere are two competing definitions out there, and they differ dramatically. One\rinterpretation of “patient” is “relatively soon.” As President Lockhart said, that’s how we used\r“patient” back in January and March of 2004. “Patient” meant that we’re going to raise rates in\rthe next few meetings. So let’s go back to March 2004, the last time we used “patient.” Well,\rthat FOMC raised the funds rate in June 2004. That’s two meetings after the use of “patient.”\rThen I went to a dictionary and looked up the word “patient,” and, actually, the definition\ris exactly the opposite. It means “not soon,” and I assume that’s the usage that my esteemed\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r128 of 219\r\rcolleague President Evans means when he says on numerous occasions that we need to be patient\rin removing accommodation. I believe President Evans would describe “sometime in 2016,”\rperhaps, as actually being patient. So, what is the FOMC trying to communicate with this word\r“patient”? Is it soon or not soon?\rI figured this out on my own—I guessed that these problems were recognized, and that\rled to the classic Fed “belt and suspenders” approach that we always take, which is to anchor\rexpectations on, apparently, this first definition, in which “patient” means “relatively soon.”\rNow, the belt is the additional language in the statement that says that the “patient” language is\rexactly entirely consistent with the October “considerable time” language. There’s no change\rthere. And the suspenders of this approach are Chair Yellen’s proposal that she explain in\rtoday’s press conference that “patient” means no increase in the next few meetings.\rNow, actually, after going through my concerns about what “patient” means, I think this\rdoes define “patient.” It’s a very effective way to explain what the word “patient” means here.\rIt does, I hope, shift us away from what “patient” meant in 2004. The combination of putting in\rthe belt of that extra sentence and adding the suspenders of the Chair explaining and putting a\rgood commentary about what “patient” means and its data dependence actually solves these\rproblems. Therefore, I can support the language that’s in the statement, conditional both on\rhaving that sentence in the paragraph that says that this is not a change in our views, and on the\rChair’s having permission to describe what “patient” means.\rI do have some lingering concerns that, when there’s consequential language in our\rpolicy decisions, I would prefer them to be explained in the statement rather than relying on the\rChair to define the terms, but maybe that’s a conversation for a later day. But, Madam Chair, I\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r129 of 219\r\rdo have great confidence that, in the press conference, you’ll be able to explain this very\reffectively. So I think that this will be fine.\rIn terms of the questions you asked, my answer to the first one is that I agree, I do think\rthat you should define “patient” as meaning no increase for at least the next couple of meetings,\ralong with the data dependence and all of that, and no decision on liftoff being made. And I do\ragree with your summarizing the SEP views on the conditions at liftoff as being further labor\rsure that this isn’t described as necessary conditions for liftoff—that we need a 1.5 percent on\rinflation or a 5.7 percent or something on unemployment—but that it’s described as, under the\rcurrent view of the Committee, these are the conditions that are expected around liftoff. Again, I\rsupport alternative B, and thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Rosengren.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Madam Chair. I support alternative B as written. I like\rseveral aspects of alternative B. First, we were overconstrained by the “considerable time”\rlanguage. Given our imperfect understanding of wage and price dynamics, we should be flexible\rto move the timing of our liftoff up or back, depending on incoming data.\rSecond, it further emphasizes that we’d be moving from time-dependent to more datadriven language as monetary policy normalizes.\rThird, patience is the appropriate policy for now. Nominal wage growth and price\rinflation have been stubbornly low. We should wait for some evidence that inflation is more\rclearly on a gradual path toward our 2 percent inflation target. Certainly, lower oil prices and a\rstronger dollar will have some effect on the overall level of prices, but to have such little\revidence of wage and price pressures indicates that we still have significant labor market slack.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r130 of 219\r\rThe challenge is likely to be determining when to stop being patient. I think it is very unlikely\rthat we will have much evidence of wage and price pressures soon, certainly not at the next two\rmeetings. In fact, the earliest is likely to be the middle of next year.\rThis will be the art of the liftoff. We want to make sure we have enough evidence that\rlabor markets have tightened, but we must have and must appreciate the need for some\rinsurance, given the long lags and uncertainty surrounding the effect of our first tightening.\rIn terms of the two questions that you have, I actually very much like the word “patient.”\rI think it is an improvement. If you define it in terms of “unlikely at the next several meetings,”\rit is very unlikely that we would have any evidence that wages and prices are going to be moving\rtoward 2 percent in the next two meetings. So I’m very comfortable with that. If anything, even\rthough we should look through the oil price changes, it’s going to be very hard to look through\rthem over the next two meetings. So I think it is very appropriate.\rIn terms of tying it to the SEP liftoff and providing a little more clarity as to what we\rwant to see to take the word “patient” out, I believe that’s more difficult. I don’t think we want\rto be overly specific on that. I would want to be confident we’re moving back to 2 percent\rinflation, and so that’s not just labor market statistics. It’s not just wages or prices. It’s looking\rat the constellation of data that we have and saying that we have more confidence than what\rwe’ve had over the past several years that we’re actually on the right path. So I would not tie it\rto labor market markers that, at the same inflation rate and with a slightly lower unemployment\rrate, would be sufficient. And I don’t think it would be sufficient just to see one piece of data on\rwages or prices. We’re going to want to look at the constellation and—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Just to clarify, what I said was that we would want to be reasonably\rconfident that inflation is moving back toward our target, even though it’s below. I meant that to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r131 of 219\r\rtake account of exactly what you’re saying. That’s not any simple statistic. It’s looking at a\rwhole constellation of factors to make that judgment.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ROSENGREN. Yes. If we’re reasonably confident that we’re back on the path\rtoward the 2 percent inflation rate, I would be comfortable with that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Evans.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EVANS. Thank you, Madam Chair. I can support alternative B today as offered,\rbecause it’s merely a modest restatement of our current patient policy strategy without\rcommitting to a date-based future action. That said, I expect the public to quickly embrace\rassessment today as I read the economic situation. After six years of inflation averaging\r1½ percent, I would prefer a course of action that maximizes our likelihood of achieving\r2 percent inflation by 2017 at the latest, and we need to hit our price-stability objective in a\rsustainable manner, not simply as a short-term burst of transitory relative price adjustments when\roil prices bounce back. Given my assessment of the economy’s fundamentals, I myself will be\rsurprised if it becomes appropriate to begin increasing short-term policy rates before March\r2016. But things can change—I recognize that.\rWithin this context, I prefer the conditional language in paragraph 3ʹ of alternative A. Its\rconditionality with respect to achieving our price-stability mandate is much clearer, and I believe\rthe public would better infer that we intend to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective sooner\rrather than later. At a time when the Bank of Japan and the ECB are struggling at the zero lower\rbound with low inflation, there’s no more powerful tool available than a strong and credible\rpublic expectation of actions to achieve this better outcome. This is an important preventive\rdefense for ourselves. Without such a marker, I fear that the focal point for liftoff will be too\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r132 of 219\r\rfirmly date-based on June 2015, without enough data conditionality, in the event our inflation\rimprovements stall.\rI did like very much some of the suggestions that President Lockhart made in terms of\rtrying to push a little further into the future the start of our normalization.\rMadam Chair, yesterday you listed a number of policy caveats related to this\rconditionality test. I believe my own list is well aligned with your comments. For me to\renvision a June 2015 liftoff as the appropriate response to economic conditions, I would like to\rsee a number of developments—first, continued strong employment growth, associated\rimprovements in other labor market indicators, and continued growth above potential.\rSecond, I’d want to see clear signs that wages were beginning to increase toward the\rrange of 3 to 4 percent that I associate with neutral cost pressures. I think this is important for\rreinforcing the evidence that resource gaps have been sufficiently narrowed and for establishing\rcost increases that would be more consistent with an underlying inflation rate of 2 percent.\rThe third important condition would be an increase in TIPS-based inflation expectations\rfrom today’s low levels. As you and President Kocherlakota mentioned yesterday, there are\rserious costs when we live in a world with low inflation, a low equilibrium real rate, and\rmonetary policy stuck at the zero lower bound. If market measures of inflation compensation are\rlower today because the market participants are much more mindful of and averse to these costly\rlow-inflation scenarios, then the FOMC should better ensure that we hit our 2 percent objective\rwith greater confidence and more quickly.\rThe final signal I would be looking for would be an increase in my inflation projection to\r2 percent in 2017 at the latest under the contemplated post-liftoff path. As you suggested\ryesterday, Madam Chair, there is a risk that core and underlying inflation measures could\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r133 of 219\r\rbecome persistently too low owing to relative price downdrafts outside of our control. You\rmentioned that you would be monitoring for things like that. It’s not your base case, of course.\rIn this case, inflation’s behavior would likely be inconsistent with our price-stability objective, in\rmy opinion. We thus may still need to reinforce our patient, data-conditional policy messages\ralong the path in order to keep inflation up.\rIt’s certainly possible that these caveats will be overcome by mid-2015. That’s part of\rthe conditionality test. Still, I continue to worry that we’re hoping to thread the needle and bring\rinflation up to 2 percent from below without ever crossing over 2 percent. I think this hopeful\rscenario is fraught with risks that inflation will stall out before we get to 2 percent. If confronted\rwith a choice of stalling at 1½ or 1¾ percent inflation versus modestly overshooting inflation at\r2¼ to 2½ percent inflation for a time, I firmly believe that the latter is more consistent with our\rstated long-run strategy for monetary policy.\rNow, on the questions that you asked, I think your characterization of the liftoff dates is\raccurate—almost all participants in 2015. I don’t disagree with that.\rIn terms of the definition of “patient,” my own preference is some adjustment along the\rlines that President Lockhart was trying to convey, so it would be longer than one to two\rmeetings. But I defer to your judgment on that. I understand the importance of this, and I would\rnot disagree with the important objectives you have for the press conference today. Thank you,\rMadam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Mester.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. MESTER. Thank you, Madam Chair. For some time I’ve argued that, as we\rapproach a more normal policy-setting environment, we should be moving our forward guidance\raway from date-based guidance to more state-contingent guidance describing the conditions we\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r134 of 219\r\rdeem important in determining appropriate policy. In reformulating the forward guidance, over\rtime, I believe we should strive to remove the focus from the date of a policy change to the\rconditions we look at in determining actual and projected progress of the economy toward our\rgoals.\rChair Yellen’s remarks yesterday, on the economic conditions and indicators she’ll be\rlooking at in coming months to inform her view of when to lift off, seemed a very good way to\rframe the discussion—perhaps not doable in the statement, but something to strive for in our\rpublic discourse and around the table. Similarly, at our October meeting, we took an important\rstep in the right direction in our statement by adding the qualifier that the timing of liftoff would\rvary if incoming information suggested either faster- or slower-than-anticipated progress toward\rour goals.\rWith the end of the asset purchase program, with market participants expecting some\rtype of change in guidance, and with the Chair holding a postmeeting press conference, we have\ra unique opportunity to take a further step today to clarify our policy expectations. Now, my\rpreferred choice of guidance would be different than in alternative B. But, given that we will be\rtaking out the “considerable time” qualifier at the next meeting, as you suggest, and as you plan\rin the press conference to clarify what “patient” means, I can support that going forward today.\rAlso, the fact that you’re going to give some context for what we’re going to have to see in order\rto have liftoff is, I think, the right way to go. So I’m very supportive of that. My own\rpreference would be not to put a number, necessarily, on core inflation but to describe that it\rprobably won’t be at 2 percent, and that we’re going to be forward-looking. So I support that. I\rdo think it’s right to change the forward guidance today, notwithstanding some of the comments\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r135 of 219\r\rthat we heard from President Lockhart and others about there being some risks to changing the\rforward guidance.\rLooking ahead, based on the economic progress that’s been made and my forecast of\rcontinued progress, I believe the time for lifting off from the zero lower bound is nearing, and\rwe have to do our best to prepare the public and markets for it. The SEP suggests the consensus\ramong participants is that liftoff is going to be in the first half of the year provided the economy\revolves as anticipated. The policy rules that we look at and the optimal control exercises in the\rTealbook all point to an approaching liftoff.\rMonetary policy will, of course, remain extremely accommodative for some time to\rcome, even after the first rate increase. And I think that’s something that we need to inform the\rpublic of as well. Yet, of course, liftoff will certainly be a historic event, given the journey the\reconomy and monetary policy have been on for the past six years.\rThe Committee always has to balance several considerations when it begins\rcontemplating a change in policy direction. But, in the current circumstances, these\rconsiderations are heightened. We’ve seen several false starts, when it looked as though the\reconomy was poised to accelerate, only to slow down again. So it’s natural to be cautious,\respecially with interest rates at the zero lower bound, making the economy more vulnerable to\rnegative shocks. At the same time, recent data suggest growth and employment may be\raccelerating more than anticipated. In addition, we’ve not been in the situation of zero interest\rrates before. So we may be underestimating the costs of moving too slowly to normalize policy.\rThe Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic developments and will do\rits best to balance these considerations. We do not know today when liftoff will be appropriate.\rIt will depend on how the economy evolves. But we do know that a large majority of\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r136 of 219\r\rparticipants assess that the economy will evolve so that liftoff will be appropriate in the first half\rof next year. With liftoff in sight, it is prudent to continue to prepare the public for the\rcontemplated policy change that will be coming so that they will not be caught off guard. And I\rdo like the fact that you’re going to use a press conference for that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Bullard.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have just a few remarks. I’m going to\rtalk about three topics. One is that the constellation of data that we face today is not consistent\rwith a policy rate pinned down at the zero lower bound, and, for this reason, I think it’s\rimportant for the Committee to be considering normalization strategies. So I’ll talk about that a\rlittle bit. The second topic is that inflation expectations are falling. I think this is of paramount\rconcern for a central bank. Inflation expectations should not fall over a horizon as long as 5 to\r10 years. We need to be ready to react to this, if necessary. Frankly, I don’t think that we’re\rready to react to this. Third, our policy options today are cementing date-dependent policy. I\ragree with President Evans on this, and I have some suggestions about how to move toward\rmore state-contingency by creating windows of meetings at which the Committee may\rpotentially move, instead of single meetings.\rOn the first topic, concerning the constellation of data, unemployment is only a few ticks\raway from our own estimates of the natural rate. If you’d rather look at indexes of labor market\rperformance, they are also not far from their long-run averages. Inflation is only a few ticks\raway from our target. Constructing a quadratic objective in inflation and unemployment\rdeviations, as we have in St. Louis, shows that this Committee is closer to achieving its goals\rthan at about 90 percent of the Committee meetings that have occurred since 1960. So I think\rthe idea that we’re far away from our goals is false.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r137 of 219\r\rThe policy stance, on the other hand, is to have the policy rate still near zero and liftoff\rstill some time away. The policy stance is dramatically different from what it has been for\rsimilar data constellations in the past. We have a large balance sheet, and we have a zero interest\rrate policy. From this perspective, our policy is badly out of position compared with historical\rnorms. For this reason, I want to push back against those who believe it’s inappropriate to be\rthinking about normalization. It’s totally appropriate to be thinking about normalization now\rand at coming meetings.\rThe second topic is that inflation expectations are falling, and I don’t think we should be\rmaking as many excuses about this as we are at this meeting. The experience in Japan over the\rpast 20 years and in the euro area today shows that allowing expectations of inflation over\rlonger-term horizons to fall can create unique and very difficult problems for central banks. We\rneed to be prepared, although it’s not my baseline case, to make a move—and possibly a\rdramatic move—to shore up inflation expectations, if that becomes necessary, over the next six\rmonths. Probably the most potent tool we have at this point, given that QE is out of the picture,\rwould be to delay the date of liftoff.\rAs many of you know, I have argued in the past that promising to stay at zero even\rlonger can be counterproductive with regard to inflation expectations, and so if we have to do\rthis, I want to do it in a particular way. If we have to delay liftoff at some point in order to shore\rup longer-run expectations, I would prefer to do that in reaction to bullish data on the economy,\ras opposed to weakening data on the economy. That would send a signal that it’s the\rexpectations of inflation we care about, and it’s not sending the signal that we think the economy\ris going to be weaker in the future, and that we’re reacting to that.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r138 of 219\r\rThis has been a very difficult issue for the Committee over the past five years, but, if we\rhave to play that card, that’s the way I would prefer to play it. That would avoid the negative\rfeedback that could otherwise occur—we’re delaying liftoff because we see a weaker economy\rin the second half of 2015 or out into 2016, and we see even lower inflation numbers. That\rprocess can become self-fulfilling and lead to a bad equilibrium, and that’s exactly what we’re\rtrying to avoid. So I would just put that out there as a possible contingency if the inflation\rexpectations situation does not turn around in the next six months. There is a fairly substantial\rrisk that inflation will continue to decline—and that, possibly, inflation expectations will\rcontinue to decline—in the months ahead.\rThe third topic is that our policy choices today are cementing too much date dependency.\rThe probabilities of action by this Committee are totally piling up on June. The primary dealer\rsurvey put no weight on meetings other than meetings that had a press conference attached, and\rput most weight on the June meeting as a possible date of liftoff. I think it’s particularly telling\rthat we have a lot of weight on the June meeting—no primary dealers, or maybe only one, on the\rsee a spread-out probability structure of three possible meetings. I’m going to suggest a way to\rdo that here.\rWhat are the dangers with putting all of your eggs in the June basket? I think one of the\rmain dangers for the Committee is that the data running up to the June meeting aren’t ideal or\raren’t what we’re hoping for. Of course, if they are, everything will go smoothly. I’m talking\rabout the case in which they’re not. Suppose we get somewhat weaker data during that period.\rThen, should the Committee decide to plow ahead, even with less-than-desirable data, that can\rerode the credibility of the Committee that policy is state dependent, because what you’re doing\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r139 of 219\r\ris saying, “We’re going to move in June even if the data don’t agree with us.” And then people\rstart to think that we’re not sufficiently attentive to incoming data on the economy.\rI also would like to reiterate that I think this harms the natural decisionmaking process on\rthe Committee. A lot of the compromise on the Committee has to do with trading off things that\ryou might do at one meeting versus doing them at the next meeting or possibly pulling them\rearlier. Because of our press conference structure, it puts a lot of pressure on certain meetings.\rMembers of the Committee feel as though, if they’re going to get something done, they want to\rget it done at a particular meeting, and it hardens positions, I think, relative to what they would\rotherwise be.\rMy solution is that we have press conferences associated with every meeting. At this\rpoint, I’m not going to insert the passionate speech about press conferences at every meeting that\rI’ve given at other meetings in the past, but I’ll reiterate a little bit of it here. I think you could\rannounce today, even at the press conference, that we’re going to have press conferences at\revery meeting in 2015, or you could say, “I would contemplate having press conferences at\revery meeting in 2015.” This would put all of the dates on the table. It would spread out the\rprobabilities the way I’m talking about. It would make all meetings ex ante identical and\rdistribute the probability of a liftoff move more or less equally among April, June, and July\rinstead of just June. It would create a window for possible action by the Committee. The\rCommittee could then walk into one of those meetings at which the data were relatively\rfavorable and say, “Okay. We’re ready to go at this meeting.” I don’t think it would matter\rmuch in any of those three meetings, in a macroeconomic sense, as long as we got going on the\rnormalization process. But it would allow us to move when the data speak to that possibility,\rinstead of having to possibly move against what the data are telling us at a particular meeting.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r140 of 219\r\rThis would mitigate, in my mind, some of the risk of a liftoff event that would be\rharkening back to the June 2013 meeting and its aftermath, in which, I think, the Committee felt\ra lot of pressure to do something at that meeting, as opposed to waiting until the August meeting.\rI don’t believe the Committee was quite ready. We put a lot of pressure on the press conference.\rThe ultimate reaction of that was that the Committee came off as quite a bit more hawkish than it\rprobably was, and we ended up with the taper tantrum and its effects in the summer of 2013.\rYou could mitigate quite a bit of this by creating this window of possible meetings at which we\rcould move.\rI do not think that the prospect of a surprise press conference fixes the situation, because\rthis is mostly about expectations, as we sit here today, about when the Committee will move.\rIt’s true that we could move at any time. Of course, we can call a meeting at any time and take\raction at any time, but we would want to do that only in particularly dire circumstances, and it\rwould shock markets to do that. So I don’t think the fact that we could call a press conference\rwould fix the problem of expectations, which are really piling up on June at this point.\rI have just a couple of further comments. One is that, Madam Chair, you asked for\rcomments on defining “patience” as “at least the next couple of meetings.” Here I’d like to\rassociate myself with the comments of President Williams, which I thought were very good.\r“Patient” could be interpreted as “a very long time.” Even if you define it in the press\rconference, there’ll still be market chatter that will continue in the coming weeks, and it might\rhave the effect of pushing out expectations of liftoff. So that’s a risk that we face. I think you\rneed to push back hard against that in the press conference in order to get this to be right.\rI also agree with President Williams that we should define things in the statement and not\rin press conference comments. If it is, in fact, the policy of the Committee, we should define it\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r141 of 219\r\rhere at the Committee. It leaves ambiguity to put too much pressure on the press conference,\rand, at some points in the past—in particular, June 2013—it didn’t work out very well.\rLet me bring up one other problem with the “patient” language that I think needs to be\raddressed. By using “patience” and then defining it as “the next couple of meetings,” we’re\rharkening back to the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which is not something I would prefer to do. I\rdo not believe that that tightening cycle was very successful in the end. The bursting of the\rhousing bubble caused global macroeconomic disaster, from which we’re still trying to recover.\rSo, saying that we’re going to use “patient” in the same way that we used it in 2004 will\rimmediately trigger a lot of discussion that we’re going to do the whole tightening cycle the way\rwe did it in the period from 2004 to 2006, which involved moves of 25 basis points at 17\rconsecutive meetings and was way too mechanical and not data dependent enough. So I would\rencourage you, Madam Chair, to push back against the interpretation that this is a repeat of the\r2004–06 tightening cycle. And, really, all of us should push back against that interpretation\rbecause I don’t think that that was a successful tightening cycle.\rFinally, my last comment on the word “patient” is that, if we include “patient” in there,\rwhich I think we will, taking “patient” out is actually the tightening move. As soon as you take\r“patient” out, it means that action is imminent. This is a general problem with this kind of\rapproach, and that can’t be fixed. The Committee should be aware of this. Once you say you’re\rgoing to take “patient” out, you’re basically committing to future action, except, perhaps, in dire\rcircumstances in which the data go in a dramatically different direction. Thanks for the\ropportunity to comment, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you very much.

The weight on June from the dealers is about 26 percent—close to 30\rfrom the sell side. The sell side actually has quite a lot of weight on the July meeting, which is\rnot a press conference meeting. So, to me, there is a slight bias to the press conference in their\rthoughts. However, most of them seem to think that there is a chance you could move at a non–\rpress conference meeting, because they seem to understand that it’s a data-dependent strategy.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Plosser.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Madam Chair. Some of my comments will align with the\rremarks of President Bullard, but I want to start off by talking about the economy a little bit and\rreminding us about the progress that we’ve made. I alluded to this somewhat yesterday.\rOver the past five quarters, GDP growth has come in above 4 percent in three of those\rquarters. Four out of those five quarters, GDP growth has been 3½ percent or greater. The only\rbad quarter was winter, as we all know. If, in December, employment comes in about as we\rexpect, the increase in employment in calendar year 2014 will be the largest since 1999. The\reconomy is improving. Yes, inflation is a bit low. I’m sympathetic to that and sensitive to that.\rBut I also believe it’s not that far away from where we would like to be, and, indeed, I don’t\rreally think that deflation is the serious problem here. We do want to get our target back up, but\rI do believe expectations are anchored in a way that will continue.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r144 of 219\r\rGiven this progress and given the state of the economy, I cannot support alternative B at\rthis meeting. Alternative C more closely aligns with my assessment of appropriate policy. I\rbelieve our policy statement—and the forward guidance, in particular—should reflect the\rperformance that we’ve seen in the economy and the expected continued progress that we think\rit’s going to make.\rOur statement needs to communicate in some way that there’s measurable probability\rthat liftoff may occur in the first quarter of next year, even if the most likely scenario is still\rmostly a message of status quo, of no change: We still are where we thought we’d be, and\rthere’s been no progress other than what we thought. Yet progress has been quite considerable.\rI worry that continuing to allow expectations to place near-zero probability of liftoff in\rthe first quarter is asking for more volatility later when we finally do lift off. It also risks making\rit more difficult to lift off earlier, because we will fear upsetting expectations. As President\rBullard suggested, expectations are piling up on June. And building those expectations up so\rhigh, I think, is not a good idea and is a recipe for volatility.\rMost policy rules that I consider—for example, those in the Tealbook B—continue to\rsuggest that liftoff should be occurring now, and that the funds rate should be significantly\rhigher than zero by June of next year. By the way, I want to emphasize that, even after liftoff\rfrom the zero bound, policy will remain highly accommodative. We need to disabuse the public\rand the markets of the notion that, somehow, highly accommodative policy means staying at\rzero until we reach our goals. To me, that is a recipe for big trouble.\rI also interpret the Board staff’s memo on the relationship between unemployment rate\rrises and recessions as highlighting the risks of keeping policy overly accommodative. I am on\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r145 of 219\r\rrecord as indicating that waiting too long to raise rates could lead to the need for more aggressive\rpolicy in the future, which could potentially lead to unnecessary volatility and instability.\rSubstituting the word “patient” for “considerable time,” to me, seems unnecessary and\rconfusing. It’s yet another adjective that we need to explain, and it’s mostly time dependent in\rits nature. At least in alternative C, we just drop the word “considerable” and put that it’ll be “a\rtime” before we lift off. Now, while I’m not happy with that because of its calendar dependence,\rat least it signals that there’s been a change in the way we’re thinking about forward guidance,\rand that something is different. Continuing to refer to time, as in alternative C, remains\rproblematic, as I said. I believe that, by using paragraph 3 in alt-C, the markets are more likely\rto interpret this language in a way that the expected funds rate would look more like our policy\rrate paths in the SEP than it does now.\rLet me turn to two issues—about the word “patience” and the suggestions of the Chair.\rAdding yet another word in “patience” that we have to define makes our statement read like\rChinese water torture: drip, drip, drip. It’s another definition and another something vague. But\rif we use such a term—and this is as President Bullard and President Williams suggested—it’s\rimportant that if the Committee believes that it means we won’t move for two meetings, then\rthat ought to go in the statement. It’s the Committee’s statement. Leaving such things to press\rconferences is dangerous and risky. If that’s what the Committee believes, it should put it in the\rstatement. I do think the statement will be read as saying that the probability of a liftoff earlier\rthan June is zero. And so we’re stuck at June.\rTo echo what President Bullard said, I don’t believe that contingency planning for a press\rconference in April would be very effective, because what we need to do is to spread the mass of\rprobability about when liftoff occurs wider and have some mass earlier in the year. If we don’t,\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r146 of 219\r\rwe’re going to find ourselves in a situation in which we’re going to get to that point and we’ll\rfeel as though we want to lift off, but we won’t because we’ll upset expectations. We’re doing\rourselves a disservice by doing it this way. So I would encourage that it go in the statement, not\rbe elaborated on in the press conference.\rFinally, I like the notion of characterizing the conditions under which we’ll lift off. I\ractually believe that that ought to be front and center in our discussion of our policy decision, not\rpatience and time. We need to reverse the ordering of those two discussions and emphasize what\rwe’re looking at when it comes to liftoff. Yet we’re still making “patient” or “considerable\rtime” the front-and-center message that we’re giving. I think that’s a mistake. We need to talk\rmore about the conditions under which we are going to lift off, make our policy state dependent,\rand not allow it to pile up on expectations of particular dates. We know that, in the past, that’s\rfrustrated us, and the more we’ve relied on time-related guidance, we have always come to regret\rit. I think it was President Bullard who suggested that, once we get “patient” in the statement,\rit’s going to be yet another word that we’re going to have to figure out how to get out from under\rand worry about the signals it’s going to give when the time comes. So I believe this path that\rwe’re on to do it this way is not serving our policy well, no matter whether you want to lift off\rlater or you want to lift off earlier. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Lacker.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. LACKER. Thank you, Madam Chair. My main concern about our choice of\rforward guidance today is that we preserve the flexibility to live up to our promise of data\rdependence. Today I think we need to be particularly mindful of the fact that the outlook for\rboth inflation and the real economy can change rapidly, and that judgments about appropriate\rpolicy can shift accordingly.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r147 of 219\r\rIt’s not hard to find examples of this in the past, especially around policy turning points.\rThe outlook for real activity shifted dramatically from late 1998 to early 1999. In late 1998, we\rwere afraid of the domestic effects of overseas turmoil, coincidentally including a fall in the\rruble, and then, in early 1999, it became clear that the effects would be minimal, and that growth\rwas picking up pretty rapidly. Similarly, the inflation outlook shifted quite significantly from\rmid-2003, when we thought inflation had sunk below 1 percent, to early 2004, when inflation\rand growth were clearly rising. My sense right now, as I talked about yesterday, is that the risks\rare tilted to the upside for real activity, and, once the transient effects of falling oil prices have\rpassed through, I suspect that the relatively small current shortfall of inflation from target could\reasily diminish rapidly.\rof you have commented on that. But, at this juncture, I think we have to leave the door open for\ran earlier move, perhaps as early as March. In the interest of transparency, I will now reveal that\rI am respondent 17, who, careful readers of the SEP will recall, wrote down April 2015 as the\rliftoff date. I did so while taking seriously the pledge of our current and previous Chairs that\rimportant policy decisions need not be confined to meetings with preannounced press\rconferences. So I appreciate your intention to explain that to the public.\rOur 2004 experience suggests that, when conditions warrant, we’re going to want to\rprepare for liftoff by providing a clear signal in the statement at the previous meeting. That’s\rjust a reality. Indeed, the 2004 experience is going to lead people to expect such notice. I think\rthe word “patient” can provide us with that flexibility. The meeting at which we drop it is the\rone at which we’re essentially signaling a move at the next meeting. I would note—and thanks\rto President Williams for introducing into the discussion a dictionary definition of “patient” as\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r148 of 219\r\r“not soon”—that I take “soon” to mean “the next meeting.” So “patient” means “not the next\rmeeting.” That’s what “patient” means to me. It seems plain that that’s the natural reading of\r“patient.” But, to me, “patient” means that we’re not going to move in January, and we can drop\r“patient” in January and move in March. That seems like the plain interpretation.\rNow, moving in April would mean making a call in March. So it would mean dropping\r“patient” in March after two uses, which is, of course, consistent with our 2004 experience. I\rseriously believe that we could receive data between now and March that make that appropriate\rto us. There’s even a chance—a smaller chance, but a chance—that we get data by the January\rmeeting that warrant signaling a March liftoff. I’d note that five of us think that we’re likely to\rget enough data to lift off in March, and I take it that they’re taking into account a meeting-ahead\rsignaling. So I’m thinking that the SEP indicates that five of us believe we could get data by\rIt would take just four more to move us to a majority to shift from Q2 to Q1—that is, a\rmajority favoring a Q1 liftoff. I don’t know whether we will or we won’t. I don’t know whether\rI’m interpreting this correctly or not. But I think it’s a possibility we should prepare for. That’s\rmy simple point. So I don’t believe we should take March off the table. Your language of “a\rcouple of meetings” does not literally do that, and, of course, the recitation of the datadependence formulation at least provides the fig leaf of contingency and of us dropping the\rsignal in January and moving in March. But I think saying “a couple of meetings” is effectively\rcoming close to the border of taking March off the table, and so I’d be disinclined to use “a\rcouple of meetings” as a formulation. If I were you, I’d prefer to back off from providing so\rstrong a signal about what “patient” means.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r149 of 219\r\rI also think that the question of a press conference in April is too important to be left to\rjust a questioner. If they all have something more important on their minds, then this\rinformation doesn’t get out. It’s important that, if we take that seriously, we need to be really\rthoughtful about how to prepare for that. The fact that we’re going to signal this a meeting in\radvance—one option is just to announce at the meeting at which we drop “patient” that we’re\rhaving a press conference at the next meeting. To my mind, it wouldn’t be inconsistent with the\rstrength of the signal that dropping “patient” is going to provide for us to essentially say, “All\rright. We’re going to have a press conference at the next meeting.” If you want to send a smoke\rscreen and provide some optionality, maybe say we’re going to have press conferences in August\rand July, too. But I think we could be more thoughtful about approaching the April press\rconference, and it’s too important to leave to just whether it’s asked in a press conference. It\rshould be part of your prepared statement.\rYour characterization of views on participants is something I’m comfortable with, but\rthere’s a nuance here that I think we need to be mindful of. We’re asked in the SEP what\rconditions would look like when we lift off. We weren’t asked, “What would you need to see to\rlift off?” Those are two different things. Some of us might lift off on a given date even if\rconditions were a little different than the forecast path we’ve written down, given the history\rwe’ve come into these meetings with. Do you see what I’m saying?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Yes. I didn’t say a whole lot about what people expect. All I said\rwas some further improvement in labor market conditions and reasonable confidence that\rinflation will move back up to 2 percent.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. LACKER. Right. Those seem to characterize what we all thought would be true\rwhen we moved, but we weren’t asked whether those were requirements, conditions, or triggers\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r150 of 219\r\rfor us moving. I know you didn’t characterize it that way, but I want to just be mindful of the\rdistinction and be careful not to characterize it that way, if we haven’t been asked about it that\rway and haven’t been really discussing those conditions as being that way, given how the SEP is\rconstructed. So those are my comments, Madam Chair. Thank you very much.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President George.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. GEORGE. Thank you, Madam Chair. Yesterday’s go-round reflected general\rconfidence in the economy’s ability to sustain growth with labor market strength and stable\rinflation expectations. This narrative, although not without noted risk and remaining weak spots,\rsuch as housing or tepid wage gains, seems to me inconsistent with a policy that continues to\rsupport negative real interest rates and is slow to normalize. So while I would have preferred to\rsignal an earlier liftoff, as do most policy rules in the Tealbook B, I can support alternative B\rtoday and its attempt to lean forward with language changes that offer additional flexibility and\rthe opportunity to underscore conditionality on a path to normalization.\rAs the Tealbook B, notes and as President Lockhart and others have mentioned, the\rhistory associated with the proposed language around “patience” may give the public some sense\rthat we are looking to a sequence of guidance changes from that period. So I think the Chair’s\rplan to emphasize data dependence and conditionality about liftoff will be especially important\rtoday. In that regard, I support both approaches that you’ve outlined around the explanation of\r“patient” and characterizing participant views. Also, in paragraph 1, I would prefer to\rcharacterize labor market conditions as having improved “further,” rather than using “somewhat”\rin that characterization. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Kocherlakota.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r151 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes—thank you, Madam Chair. I have a couple of remarks.\rI’m going to deviate from my prepared text to start off with, and then I’ll come back to my\rprepared text.\rMy first remark is about the thinking, as I hear it, around liftoff. I’m concerned, I guess,\rabout the thinking of liftoff as this discrete event. President Mester described it as historic. I\rthink President Lockhart has used that same term in public remarks. I worry that we’re bulking\rit too large as a discrete event and that we’re viewing it as very irreversible.\rI listened to your description of the conditions that are likely to prevail at the time of\rliftoff. This is obviously not going to be my preferred policy path, but I thought you did a good\rjob yesterday of describing the conditions that are likely to prevail. Inflation might be well\rbelow target still at that time. I think we have to face the fact that this Committee is going to be\rvery—well, let me say a couple of things. One is, it would be better if we were to be planning\rmore strategically about what post-liftoff policy is going to look like. We have a little bit of time\rleft. We don’t want to have it be that we’re going to raise interest rates by 25 basis points every\rother meeting. We want to have something that’s more responsive to the ebb and flow of data\rthan just having a sequence or plan like that. And we want to be prepared psychologically,\rwithin the Committee and publicly, for the possibility that we might return to the zero lower\rbound, if necessary, to stimulate the economy if conditions evolve accordingly.\rIf we build this up too much externally, communicating that liftoff is a historic event and\rwe’re finally liberating the U.S. economy from the chains that it’s been in for the past eight\ryears, that makes it very challenging for us to reverse course after liftoff. So there are two\raspects to what I’m trying to say. The first is planning more strategically within the Committee\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r152 of 219\r\rfor what we’re going to be doing after liftoff, and then the second is communicating, I think,\rabout what that strategy is likely to be.\rThe second piece I wanted to comment on concerns my thinking. I believe it’s useful to\rtie back our policy recommendations to our consensus statement. So I want to say a couple of\rthings about the maximum-employment mandate. We’ve had a great year in terms of\remployment. President Plosser emphasized the right points yesterday. I agree with this\rcompletely. It was a fantastic year in terms of employment. But my thinking about the\remployment mandate is basically asymmetric. I don’t believe that it was included in the Federal\rReserve Act as a way to tighten policy. It’s fundamentally in there as a way to provide a way to\rease policy relative to what would be true if we had only a price-stability mandate. More\rcolloquially, no one is going to complain to the Federal Reserve, “You’ve created way too many\rjobs. Stop creating so many jobs.” That’s what promoting maximum employment means—\rtrying to make jobs as high as you can, given you’ve got a price-stability mandate.\rSo the growth in employment is very welcome. It hasn’t influenced my inflation outlook\rthat much relative to a year ago, though, for a variety of reasons. So I don’t view it as\rnecessitating a change in policy stance. And, regarding a concern that President Plosser raised\rabout employment—if we overshoot on employment, we might have to raise rates in order to\rbring it back down—I think you’d want to average out. You might have high employment for\rsome period of time and then have lower employment later. The higher employment is a good\rthing, so we want to take that into account as a positive sign. We’re not about changes per se—\rit’s about the levels we’re trying to achieve.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r153 of 219\r\rOkay. Those are the two things I wanted to hit on. I hope I’m encouraging a more\rstrategic approach to both thinking and communicating about post-liftoff policy, and at least my\rown thinking about the employment mandate is, as I described, basically asymmetric.\rWith all of that in mind, Madam Chair, at this meeting I’m unwilling to support\ralternative B. I would have been willing to support alternative A, especially with paragraph 3ʹ.\rBut, as you’ll hear, my analysis of the current situation suggests that an even stronger response is\rdesirable. The situation as I see it is characterized by three key facts. The first fact is about past\rinflation. Year-over-year inflation has run below our 2 percent target for over 30 months.\rEssentially since the time we announced the target, it’s fallen below target and has stayed below\rtarget.\rThe second fact is about future inflation. The current FOMC staff projection is that\rinflation will be below target in each of the next four years. There is risk to that outlook, as\rGovernor Fischer reminded us yesterday. We should be thinking about this. I believe the right\rway to think about this is more in probability space. The staff projection means that in the staff’s\rassessment, in any of the next four years, the probability of inflation’s being below target is\rlarger than 50 percent. If we weight that, as our Minneapolis memo encouraged us to do, by\rwhat kinds of real conditions associated with those low-inflation outcomes are likely to prevail, I\rthink you would be driven to say that the likelihood of low inflation is larger even than 50\rpercent.\rFact 1: We’ve had low, below-target inflation for 30 months.\rFact 2: Future inflation looks as though it’s going to be low, according to the staff\rforecast, for four years.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r154 of 219\r\rFact 3: Longer-term inflation expectations have declined. From November 2010 through\rthat longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Because of the decline in longer-term\rinflation expectations in the past few months, at least as reflected in the market-based measures,\rthe Committee has not been able to make this assertion in the past two FOMC statements—and\rin the one that I suspect will be issued today.\rWhat is a proposed response to these three facts—low inflation for the past two and a half\ryears, low inflation for the next four years, and declining long-term inflation expectations? The\rproposed response to these three facts in alternative B is to communicate that the FOMC is\rcontinuing on the path of gradual removal of accommodation that it initiated a year ago—or,\rmore arguably, in May 2013.\rIn my assessment, the FOMC’s failure to respond to weak inflation runs the risk of\rcreating a harmful downward slide in inflation and inflation expectations of the kind that we\rhave seen in Japan and Europe. I’ll emphasize again that I see this as a risk. It’s not my baseline\routlook—it is a risk. I see this risk as unacceptable, given how hard it would be for the FOMC\rto respond successfully if this risk did, in fact, materialize.\rAs I said, I would have been willing to support alternative A at this meeting. But my\rpreferred response would be for the FOMC to communicate that it’ll keep the target range for the\rfed funds rate unchanged as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for the inflation rate\rremains below 2 percent. Going further than that, I think the FOMC should also make clear that,\rif this forward guidance were to prove inadequate in terms of moving inflation back to target, the\rCommittee is willing to use additional tools, such as asset purchases, to push inflation and\rinflation expectations upward.

Madam Chair, you’re getting a considerable range of views at this\rmeeting, and I’m going to express a view that’s counter to what my distinguished colleague from\rMinneapolis just expressed.\rI went back to the transcript of the October meeting. On page 139, I said, “Optimal\rpolicy is very sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Given the sensitivity, I don’t want to\rbe locked into a particular timing of liftoff or pace of substantive rate increases. . . . I\rconsider”—and I’m quoting myself, my favorite source—“‘considerable time’ as having been,\rand continuing to be, a bad idea. I believe that we need to consider this in December. If\reconomic conditions improve between now and then, that will certainly condition my vote then.”\rI looked through some of the comments of our colleagues. Governor Powell, for\rexample, said on page 158, “It may well be that in December, depending on conditions and\rexpectations, we can take [‘considerable time’] out of the statement completely.” President\rMester said, “My hope is that in December we will find a way to omit the reference to the\rconclusion of the purchase program in our forward guidance [and] replace ‘considerable time.’ ”\rThen she went on to say that we will know from the December SEP if our policy intentions have\rshifted.\rWe say we are, as President Lacker mentioned, data dependent. At that meeting in\rpolicy would be data driven, not date driven, and trying to take that date-driven edge off it. If\rour claims that policy is data dependent are to have credibility at all, I believe we must signal\rthat our expectations for liftoff have shifted forward. Also, the sentences we have that have\r“patient” as a qualifier and which, as you’ve indicated, you will explain during the press\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r156 of 219\r\rconference—I’ll get to that in a minute—retain what I call the past tense pluperfect reference,\rwhich is to October when we’re issuing a statement in December. I believe that “the conditions\rhave changed,” to quote Governor Powell, and that expectations have changed and the data have\rchanged, to quote myself. And our SEP has five members expecting liftoff in the first quarter\rand seven expecting it in the second quarter, so that’s a heavy weight out of the 17 of us who are\rat the table. The point is, we have to recognize—and I don’t believe alternative B appropriately\rrecognizes—the progress that’s been made in the data, and I don’t believe that the way the\rstatement is written shifts forward to the degree I would like to see it shifting forward.\rYesterday Governor Tarullo said we need to be pragmatic. So if you’ll indulge me for a\rsecond, I’m going to go back to my past. I started out as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval\rAcademy. I was taught to drive ships. I was stationed on a ship called the USS Truckee. It\rcontained 18 million gallons of the most explosive fuel of all. It was a jet fueler. Prudence\rdemanded that we would ease back on the throttle as we approached our port or near the dock.\rOtherwise, we ran a substantial risk. Well, we’re considerably closer to that dock now, from an\reconomic standpoint, given the data—even closer than I thought we would be at our previous\rmeeting. Yet, as we get closer, the economy is picking up speed and momentum.\rIt would be irresponsible not to take these changed circumstances into account and\racknowledge them in our statement. I don’t believe the statement does that. Madam Chair,\rmuch as I’d love to drive across the country with you from San Francisco all of the way to the\rLincoln Tunnel—and I think we’d have a lot of fun—I do like the boating or ship analogy better\rthan the driving analogy because a ship doesn’t have brakes and is relatively unforgiving if you\rovershoot your destination. In the case of the ship I was on, we would blow up.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r157 of 219\r\rWe have substantial combustible fuel in $2.9 trillion in reserves. If you multiply that by\rthe factor of other liquidity in the system, I really do believe that we are in a similar situation to\rthe docking of the ship that I was taught to drive. You don’t throw the engine into reverse, move\rto a restrictive policy stance, and immediately arrest your forward motion. So I believe that, as\rwe approach this dock and as we see in the data that we’re picking up momentum on the\reconomy, it’s important to start before April in beginning the process of throttling back and\rarresting our motion.\rIt’s clear from the statement you made earlier—and I say this with the greatest respect—\rand from what I heard at the table yesterday, particularly given how people felt and the likely\rvoters next year, that the intention is certainly to move toward possibly throttling back in June.\rAnd Bill’s answer to my question just before dinner confirmed my view on that. I’m not saying\rit’s wrong, Bill—I’m just saying that that seems to be the sentiment at the table. So I cannot\rsupport alternative B.\rNow, I realize there are tail risks out there. There was reference yesterday to the\remerging markets, in particular. I would be very cautious—and I’ve said this before—in dealing\rwith Japan as an analogy. I’ve lived there. I’ve worked there. Governor Brainard and I dealt\rwith that. I dealt with it in the Carter Administration, which was a long time ago, Stan. But you\rcannot possibly liken us to Japan, given the gearing of that economy and given the structural\rdeficiencies that that economy has. Therefore, I do not like, and have never liked, that analogy.\rWith regard to Russia, you’re right—it’s worrisome. I think the sanctions present a\rgreater issue than even the oil price declines, although that clearly compounds the situation.\rWhat you have is a fierce animal, trapped and caught in a cage, and I don’t believe we should be\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r158 of 219\r\rspending our time worrying about contagion from Russia or what we might do to condition\ranything that has to do with their behavioral pattern.\rWith regard to the other emerging countries, again, we all know that some did well in\rtaking advantage of the low interest rate period to restructure their economies, and that others did\rextremely poorly. So I think we have to worry about our own ship here. Our ship of the\reconomy is indeed approaching the dock that we had, in terms of employment and economic\rprogress, and I think we should start throttling back a little bit earlier.\rI would agree with President Williams on one thing—taking out the word “somewhat.”\rIn fact, I’d take out the words “somewhat further” and just say “labor market conditions\rimproved.” They have. So I would at least take out the word “somewhat,” and I would suggest\rtaking out the word “further” as well.\rWith regard to your point, I would simply suggest that you avoid a fixation on having to\rbe at 2 percent inflation, if we have supply-driven disinflationary pressures, in order to start\rliftoff, as long as you and our successor Committee feel that the expectations are holding.\rI’ll add one other thing. Having been on the first communications subcommittee, I\rsuggested then that whoever was Chair should have a press conference at every meeting. I’m not\rtrying to flatter you, but you have the talent to do that, and I think you should consider it. The\rquestion of when you announce that is really a sensitive issue. I wouldn’t announce that here,\rbecause it telescopes a little bit. But you might consider saying at the next press conference,\r“We’re having a press conference at every meeting,” because I believe it can be done. I also like\rit because it gets us out of here well before 12:00 noon. [Laughter] Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Okay. Governor—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Remember, Bill English said yesterday that that anchoring could surprise\rsome investors. I understand why it’s there. Again, I refer to it as past tense pluperfect only\rbecause it’s an odd juxtaposition. Yet the attempt is to clarify it with the word “patient.” I think\r“patient” confounds it the way it’s written, but that’s a minority opinion, obviously.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Fischer.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. Thank you, Madam Chair. Almost everything I want to say has been\rsaid, but I’ll put it together differently. The one thing that hasn’t been said is what I was sure\rwould have been said, which is this quote from Through the Looking-Glass, by Lewis Carroll:\r“‘When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I\rchoose it to mean—neither more nor less.’” I thought that was going to be the theme of several\rspeeches. [Laughter] Actually, I was in the Williams school of “patient,” but then I realized\rthat, having grown up in the British Empire, in which you say things like “terribly nice,”\rmeaning “very nice”—[laughter]—I’m not a reliable guide to what this term means.\rOn the issues, this has been a very good discussion. A lot of very interesting things have\rbeen said, but we also have to make a decision. It was generally agreed yesterday, and\reverybody today has agreed, that the labor market has been improving recently, particularly in\rthe past two months, and is now within hailing distance of the full-employment rate of\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r160 of 219\r\runemployment as defined by this meeting’s SEP. We also agreed that the inflation picture is\rmore complicated in that the staff forecast does not get to the 2 percent target level even by\r2017.\rSo when should we begin normalizing? I believe a balanced approach would wait for\rliftoff until we have both employment and inflation not far from their target levels and expected\rto move toward their targets. With unemployment at 5.8 percent and core inflation at\r1.5 percent, both employment and inflation are not far from their target levels. In saying that, I\rknow I’ll be told that 0.5 percent on a number that’s 2 percent is 25 percent. Well, that’s true.\rBut the precision of that—we had from President Kocherlakota a very interesting discussion on\rhow to think about the unemployment target and suggesting that the next consensus statement\rshould say that the target level of unemployment is zero, and so forth.\rOn the inflation target, we really do not have a good basis for deciding that it’s 2 percent\rand not 1.8 percent. I worked at the Bank of Israel with a target range for the inflation rate, but I\runderstand that that was rejected in the consensus statement. But it seems to me that there’s a\rsignificant degree of uncertainty, and that if we were to get stuck at 1.8 percent and the economy\rwas growing rapidly, and so forth, we should not take that as something that requires us to do\rmore to get to 2 percent.\rWhat we have in the forecasts—probably our best forecasts are the staff estimates—but\ralso in the SEP is that they both expect a move toward the target levels, albeit at different rates.\rSo we need a few more months of data to convince ourselves that the situation justifies the start\rof normalization, and the wording in alternative B basically says that.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r161 of 219\r\rIn alt-B, I would also take out the word “somewhat.” I wouldn’t take out the word\r“further,” because we had enormous amounts of progress on unemployment before the October\rmeeting, and we ought to recognize that as well as what’s happened since October.\rI would like to just mention a few things that we need to take into account before we start\rnormalizing. First, we need to explain repeatedly that liftoff is the end of one story, that of the\rbattle of the zero lower bound, but it is also the start of the no-less-important story of\rnormalization. And I agree with what was said by President Lacker and by others around the\rtable—that we really are overemphasizing the importance of the liftoff, not in absolute terms but\rrelative to what will happen later.\rSecond, every time we raise rates, we are going to go through a procedure like the one\rwe’ve gone through now. I don’t see that it’s going to be very different. I think, as somebody\rwho wasn’t here before, that we are doing things in a different way—with more consensus, more\refforts to reach a consensus, and models that have advanced significantly since, say, 20 years ago\rand even since 2004—and that we’re operating on a new basis. In that basis, we’ll find every\rthe situation. That means that we need to turn our attention and that of the staff, whose technical\rexpertise I value more and more every day, even more to the technical issues that will arise as we\rnormalize, including how to coordinate the use of our two interest rate instruments and when to\rbegin asset sales, which we’ve left on the side, although there was considerable praise yesterday\rfrom President Fisher for this memo that was sent around by the Desk. I hope to absorb that\rthoroughly on the weekend.\rThird, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about how normalization will play out. We need\rto continually remind people that the future is uncertain, and I think we also need to try to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r162 of 219\r\ranticipate the main difficulties we could face during the normalization process. I’m sure the\rDesk has very clear ideas on this. I suspect we also ought to be looking at the sorts of\rdisturbances, most of them economic—possibly not all economic—that are likely to challenge\rthe markets.\rWhen we lift off, we need to remind ourselves—and this follows on things that I think\rboth President Bullard and President Plosser said—that an interest rate of zero is far from\rnormal, and that monetary policy will continue to be expansionary for a long while, at least for\rseveral years after liftoff. We should also remind ourselves not to get into the mode of “The Fed\rcontinued tightening.” “The Fed continued normalizing” is what we will be doing.\rWhat is the bottom line? When should we lift off? Well, the answer is, when the data\rtell us to do so. And that depends very much on what happens in the next few months, in\rparticular. I believe that we do not have language that rules out March. It’s less likely by far\rthan June, but it is still possible that the data will surprise us on the upside. Thank you, Madam\rChair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. President Kocherlakota.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes—thank you, Madam Chair. I wanted to clarify what I\rwas saying about the employment mandate, because I certainly wasn’t trying to imply that the\rFOMC should have a target of zero percent unemployment. I think about the two mandates as\rlexicographic, so if inflation is running below target, I don’t need to look at the employment\rmandate at all. You’re just trying to get inflation back to target. Or if the outlook for inflation is\rrunning above target, then the employment mandate comes into play. We have to decide\rwhether it’s worth the cost to bring inflation down and how we want to do that—well, I think\rI’ve tried to say what I meant to say.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r163 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FISCHER. Yes. Well, I’m just not sure how you signed on to the consensus\rstatement.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. I’m asking myself that question. [Laughter]\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Tarullo.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me first say that I realized after\ryesterday’s meeting I had taken a sufficient amount of cold medicine that I wasn’t entirely sure\rwhat I had said. So if I contradict anything I said yesterday, apologies in advance. This is what I\rreally believe. [Laughter]\rLet me begin by saying I support alternative B. I recognize, as a number of you have\rpointed out, that there are risks around any shift in language, particularly a shift that is not going\rcold turkey in getting markets off of thinking in calendar terms but, instead, is trying to wean\rthem somewhat gradually with the use of an intermediate term.\rI found that a lot of what John said resonated with me—that there are a number of paths\rto the end, but the end is still the same, which is, when we reach liftoff, to be doing it in a way\rthat I would characterize as eliciting significant but not violent market reactions, because it\rwould have already been sufficiently anticipated, both with economic developments and with\rthings that the Chair had said. So I think that, with the Chair’s comments not just at the press\rconference today, but also in the various public opportunities that she has in the first part of and\rmiddle of next year, we are in a better position to be weaning the market from a calendar sense\rand getting them more into a data-dependent sense, which we all purport to believe is the optimal\rsituation.\rThe result of everything we’re doing today probably will be to move to more of a focus\ron June. That’s not actually where I am. I don’t know what dot number I was, but I had a\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r164 of 219\r\rpassing that this is another instance in which the failure of the SEP to identify who’s a voter in\rwhich year means that we’re providing a little bit of misleading information to markets, because,\rbased on what I’ve heard around the table, I think next year’s voters are a little bit less front\rloaded in terms of their liftoff date than the participants as a whole. But that’s something to be\rtaken up another day.\rThe final thing I wanted to say is, the analytic issue of whether the greater risk lies in\rfalling behind an inflation increase, on the one hand, or a premature liftoff, on the other, is one to\rwhich many people have alluded, but we haven’t actually discussed it very much. People have\rmore given their conclusions, either based on faith or based on some reference to past\rcircumstances. I’m inclined to think that the risk of premature liftoff in current circumstances is\rgreater than the risk of falling behind the inflation curve. In fact, as I sit here today, I think it’s at\rleast as likely that I’ll ultimately be motivated to favor liftoff for financial-stability reasons as for\rinflation reasons.\rBut it would be useful, perhaps at some point early in the new year, either to have a\rdiscussion in a formal sense or to have us individually give some thought to, and bring our\rthoughts to the table on, this point, because the current conditions are sufficiently different from\rpast cycles of tightening or deferral of tightening as to maybe make some of those semiautomatic\rreferences not as salient as they might be. One question that arises is, would the possible need\rfor a steeper increase after initial liftoff, because liftoff had been delayed, end up imposing costs\rthat outweigh those benefits of delay in the first place?\rNarayana raised a number of issues—and Governor Fischer did, too—in talking about\rwhat the path is going to be following liftoff. Each of those, as Governor Fischer says, is not\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r165 of 219\r\rgoing to be able to be pinned down because of the uncertainty about what will happen, but a bit\rmore analysis around that may clarify at least my thinking as to when, in these various states,\rliftoff might be appropriate.\rI will say that one of the reasons why I’m inclined toward the greater risk lying in the\rpremature liftoff than in waiting too long is precisely that almost everyone around the table\ranticipates not a big acceleration in economic growth but, instead, more or less the maintenance\rof the growth that we’ve seen in everything but the first quarter of this year. So it doesn’t feel\rlike a circumstance in which things can get away from us, whereas we are at the zero lower\rbound, we’ve got deflationary risks, at least in other parts of the world, and thus, again, my\rinstinct is that the risks of going too quickly outweigh the risks of waiting a bit. And President\rKocherlakota raised a very good point: Why don’t we think about going back, even if we have\rincreased? Well, here another consideration would be, what does that do to the credibility of the\rinstitution in the eyes of the market if we lift off one month and, a few months later, are saying,\r“No, actually, we need to go back to zero again”?\rAll of that, I think, would profit from a formalized discussion that the staff and the Chair\rlay out for us or even from individuals picking up that theme over the next couple of meetings.\rBut with all of that, Madam Chair, I support alternative B, and even I think that removing\r“somewhat” would be okay.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Great. And let me say that we are tentatively planning both a staff\rpaper and a discussion of the issues that you mentioned for January. So I hope we will have a\rmore significant discussion about that and a full go-round.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. TARULLO. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Powell.\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r166 of 219\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. POWELL. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will support alternative B, and I would also\rsupport removing “somewhat.”\rIf the economy moves generally along the baseline path, then I would support lifting off\rin June, other things being equal. I don’t see March as at all off the table. It would take strong\rresults to justify it, but I didn’t think in September that we would have the kinds of employment\rreports we’ve had since September. So if you can imagine, we get three more employment\rreports between now and the March meeting, and, if we get really strong employment reports\rand, in addition, inflation provides grounds for confidence in a return to 2 percent, then I would\rsee March as potentially on the table as well. Having said that, I also put significant probability\rmass on liftoff later than June, as in the primary dealer survey. It’s all going to depend on the\rpath of the economy. I actually think we’re getting to the point at which personal assessments of\rprobability matter less than having a plan for dealing with the entire probability distribution.\rGetting to the language, I do like “patient” for both practical and other reasons. First, in\rterms of “considerable time,” I guess I regard “considerable time” as effectively out of the\rstatement, given, as President Mester pointed out, that this is really referring back to a previous\rstatement. It effectively is a dead letter and certainly will be a dead letter during the press\rconference. When someone asks you if it’ll be in the January statement, I suspect you’ll say,\r“No.” So I think it is out of the statement for all practical purposes at that point.\rI also think we’re talking now about one or two meetings in either direction, and there’s\rnot a lot that really rides on that in the long run. As long as we are transparent, predictable, and\rdata-based in what we do here, it’ll be okay.\rHaving said that, there’s another reason that I like the word “patient”: I look at the risk\rweighting of undershooting and overshooting by a couple of meetings as asymmetric. The very\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r167 of 219\r\rdifficult mistake to recover from would be to go too soon. Maybe there’s an exogenous event,\rbut, in any case, we go, and then suddenly things turn bad for some reason that will look really\robvious in hindsight. Now we’re sitting around this table talking about restarting the asset\rpurchase program and suffering from immense criticism that will be very hard to defend. That’s\ra place where we really don’t want to be. If we turn out to be a meeting or two late, we can\rmove a little faster. There are ways to deal with that. I just don’t see those risks as particularly\rsymmetric.\rI think it’s appropriate at this time to start to prepare the public—the markets, really—for\rthe onset of normalization. There could easily be a reaction in the markets after this statement. I\rthink that would be appropriate.\rTurning to your two questions at the beginning of this round, Madam Chair, I’m okay\rwith your definition of “patient.” I do think we need a shorter-handled tool, in a way.\r“Considerable time” was really a six-month tool. “Patient” is really a two-meeting tool. I realize\rthat’s time based and kind of awkward, but it’s also swimming in a sea of data dependency and\rseems to work, and we should do what works.\rIn terms of leaving meetings on the table, I’ll conclude with this thought: It’s really a bad\ridea to think that we could raise rates and do it in the sense of calling a press conference\rsuddenly at the end of a meeting or the day of a meeting. That is not a way I would go at all. I\rjust think it can’t be that important to do it. It would have to be really important to raise rates\rthen rather than seven weeks later. It would be a big surprise to the market. This is a\rtremendously important event in our history, and it ought not to be thrown together in that way.\rSo I guess I would offer for consideration a thought that, if it’s a close call in March, then there\rwould be an option to put April on the table, and maybe July as well, at that time, but well in\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r168 of 219\r\radvance. If we’re going to put April on the table, I wouldn’t do it on the day of the meeting. I\rwould do it as part of the March meeting so that we don’t surprise the market.\rAs I said, it’s really critical that we be transparent. The market will come to understand\rwhat we’re going to do if we’re transparent and predictable, and that’s tremendously important\rin this process. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Governor Brainard.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. BRAINARD. Thank you. Since we last met, we have seen two strong payroll\rreports, and the labor market is clearly continuing to strengthen, which is very welcome. But, of\rcourse, we also see continued risks associated with below-target inflation, with some\rdeterioration in market-based measures of inflation expectations and this taking place against a\rglobal backdrop, which is broadly disinflationary.\rWhat does this mean for policy? First, it’s important to acknowledge that the continued\runderlying momentum in the economy validates the pace of tapering and the end of asset\rpurchases. That’s a very welcome change from previous attempts to end unconventional policy.\rSecond, conditions overall, I think, validate our strategy of remaining somewhat cautious on the\rremoval of monetary accommodation, although I believe we can acknowledge that the date of\rliftoff is now coming more clearly into view.\rFor my part, I think market expectations are nicely aligned with our outlook on the\rappropriate timing of liftoff, which makes me quite cautious about any change in wording that\rcould perturb current expectations. The danger is that markets take signal from the change in\rwording when none is intended, and, of course, we know from past experience how disruptive\runintended signals can be. As a result, I would probably have been more comfortable leaving\rthe existing forward guidance anchored and making the outlook section of the statement do more\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r169 of 219\r\rof the work. I think I would not have been inclined to introduce a new qualitative concept. I\rworry, in particular, that the choice of the word “patient” could be read as suggesting the same\rtiming and pace of tightening as the last time the word was used, neither of which is appropriate\rto today’s conditions. However, I think we all recognize that many around this table did not like\rthe existing language and were very uncomfortable keeping it, and, under those constraints, I\rthink the language in alternative B is as good an approach as any of the alternatives. In\rparticular, I would give my vote to the Chair in navigating these shoals and gently guiding\rWith regard to the outlook, the main takeaways on the outlook for the full employment\rpart of the dual mandate are captured well by paragraphs 1 and 2. I would also be inclined to\rdrop the word “somewhat.”\rDescribing the recent data and outlook for inflation is trickier. I still believe, in light of\rrecent data, that, as resource slack diminishes further, inflation is likely to move back up toward\rour 2 percent goal, but the risks to that outlook are clearly on the downside. So I think it’s right\rto note, as alternative B does, some concern about the inflation outlook and just to recognize\rthat, if we were in the same circumstances with a sharp increase in the price of oil and as far\raway from the 2 percent target above it as we are currently below it, we would certainly note that\rin our statement. I believe it’s appropriate to do that here. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Well, thank you all for your—\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. You’ve got one more.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Oh, sorry. My deepest apologies.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. No worries. It happened one time under Chairman\rBernanke’s watch, too. So you can do it once. [Laughter.] I support alternative B, and I am\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r170 of 219\r\rcomfortable with what the Chair proposes to communicate at the press conference in terms of the\r“patient” language. I think “at least the next couple of meetings” is a good way of characterizing\rit. Also, the way you propose to characterize the participants’ views for 2015 sounds very good\rto me.\rBefore I get into the statement language, I do want to make some more general\robservations about monetary policy. First, in terms of my own thinking, I believe the likely\rtiming of liftoff has moved in somewhat, given the strength of the recent data and the fact that I\rhave greater confidence now that that momentum will be sustained in 2015. So it’s not just\rhaving strong employment reports, but also being more confident that the momentum will be\rsustained. Before, I was putting more of my weight on June than other meetings, but my\rexpectations were more skewed June or later. Now I would say that I see June as more of a\rmidpoint, with the probability weight of June also increasing somewhat.\rThe important question in my mind, as I talked about yesterday, is how much weight to\rgive to the decline in inflation that’s been generated by this sharp drop in energy prices. My own\rbias has been mostly to look through that decline as long as the decline does not lead to a fall in\rwage compensation and other recent nominal income trends are largely undisturbed, and\rprovided that inflation expectations remain broadly anchored. To date, I view these two\rconditions as still in place, and, because lower oil prices are likely to be a net positive for\rgrowth, that’s also important, as it increases my confidence in the sustainability of the expansion.\rSo, for the time being, I’m very much looking through the decline in oil prices, although that\rcould change in light of future developments.\rSecond, in terms of this issue of being patient with respect to the timing of liftoff, not in\rterms of the statement language but more as a general concept, I think it’s also important not to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r171 of 219\r\rbe too patient. For example, some argue—and I’ve made the argument myself—that it would be\rless risky to be a little bit late rather than a bit early in terms of the timing of liftoff. I still agree\rwith that, but I do think it’s important not to push that idea too far. In particular, if we were too\rlate and the unemployment rate were to fall considerably below the natural rate, inflation could\rrise substantially above our 2 percent objective. I understand that the Phillips curve is very flat,\rso there’s a low probability of this happening. But this rests on the very strong assumption that\rinflation expectations will remain well anchored even at very low unemployment rates, and I’m\rjust not sure that that’s actually the case. If the unemployment rate fell very low, the Phillips\rcurve would steepen, and so there’s a risk in that. Now, some argue that, if that happened, we\rhave the tools to deal with that situation. I think that’s true, but if we’re late, we would really\rhave to make monetary policy tight in order to push the unemployment rate up, and that would\rbe quite problematic.\rThe staff memo talks about the fact that, in the postwar period, every time the\runemployment rate has risen four-tenths of 1 percent or more on a three-month moving-average\rbasis, the U.S. economy has tumbled back into recession. That’s not something that I want to\rrevisit any time soon, because I don’t think I want to probe the zero lower bound again, at least\rduring my tenure.\rThird, I believe it’s desirable to get off the zero lower bound as long as we think we can\rdo so safely. Although we refer to a rise in the federal funds rate target as a tightening of\rmonetary policy—and this harkens back to what Stan was saying—there’s a problem there in\rterms of talking about the tightening of monetary policy, because all that the first hikes are going\rto do is to be a very slight removal of a very high level of accommodation. So I think we need to\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r172 of 219\r\remphasize that fact in our communications—that even after the initial few tightening moves,\rmonetary policy will still be very supportive of economic activity.\rFourth, in terms of how fast to go once we begin to raise the federal funds rate,\robviously, the economic news will be very important. But how financial market conditions\revolve is going to be important as well, and this deserves more emphasis in terms of our\rcommunications. The linkage of monetary policy to the real economy works through the\rtransmission channel of financial market conditions. So if it’s like the taper-tantrum episode and\rif financial conditions were to tighten significantly with the first rate hike, then we should go\rmore slowly, everything else being equal. Conversely, if financial conditions don’t tighten at all,\rwhich has been the situation since we began to end the asset purchase program, then we need to\rmove more quickly. And I think we need to get market participants sensitized to this—that\rfinancial market conditions are going to be an important factor in our thinking in terms of the\rmonetary policy normalization process. If they internalize the importance of financial market\rconditions in our own thinking, this would presumably reduce the risk of unusually large\rmovements in financial market conditions in response to our actions. This would be a good\routcome, at least initially, because our control of financial market conditions might be quite poor\rat first. In my mind, raising short-term rates for the first time in more than six years is a\rsubstantial regime shift.\rFinally, given all of the uncertainties about how financial conditions will respond at\rliftoff, I do think it’s important that we try to have liftoff occur with as little drama as possible.\rThere’s already going to be plenty of drama in lifting off with a new set of tools and in a regime\rshift of raising short-term rates after more than six years at the zero lower bound. So I do think\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r173 of 219\r\rwe want to foreshadow the expected timing of tightening as much as is feasible, subject to the\rinherent uncertainties of the economic outlook.\rIn an ideal scenario, the initial rate hike would occur precisely when it’s broadly\rexpected. This would work best to minimize the risks of another taper tantrum and minimize the\rrisks of disruption to global financial markets. It also might help minimize the risks of the types\rof large-scale capital flow reversals that we saw in 2013 that made life particularly difficult for\rsome emerging market economies.\rTurning now to the statement, I think we want the statement to be read as modestly\rhawkish, reinforcing the notion that June, conditional on the data coming in relatively close to\rour expectations, is becoming more likely. The Chair can reinforce this at the press conference.\rThe statement generally does this, and, particularly, it seems a little bit more positive about the\rgrowth outlook. It doesn’t overemphasize the fact that inflation is below our objective, noting in\rparagraph 2 that inflation is expected to move back toward target. We could even be a little bit\rmore positive on the growth side in paragraph 1, but I can accept it as written. I would take out\rthe word “somewhat” because I do think we want to indicate that we really have upgraded our\routlook a little bit. So I definitely would support that.\rGetting the right message on inflation is very important right now because a lot of market\rparticipants are unclear about how much weight we will give to inflation in determining the\rtiming of liftoff. We need to make it very clear that we don’t have an inflation threshold. In\rother words, there’s not a requirement that inflation must be moving up at the time of liftoff.\rInstead, we just must expect that inflation will rise in the future back to our 2 percent objective.\rLiftoff is about lessening the degree of extreme monetary accommodation, and, of\rcourse, you want to begin this process well before employment and inflation reach your\r\r\fDecember 16–17, 2014\r\r174 of 219\r\robjectives. I believe many market participants are confused about this, and that explains some of\rthe difference between what we think we’re going to do and what market participants expect for\rthis. So I think we have to work on that a little bit. Thank you, Madam Chair.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you. Okay.

Good afternoon.\rAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy\rgoals that Congress has given us—maximum employment and price stability. Since the\rbeginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to\rensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the\reconomy. Today, my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our\rcommitment to support the economy in this challenging time.\rEconomic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second-quarter level. The\rreopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate\rof 33 percent in the third quarter. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has\rmoderated. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has\rmoved above its pre-pandemic level. In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due\rto ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel\rand hospitality. The overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federal stimulus\rpayments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many\rfamilies and individuals. The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported\rin part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment has also picked up. Even so, overall\reconomic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains\rhighly uncertain.\rIn the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April\rhave been regained as many people were able to return to work. As with overall economic\ractivity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated. The unemployment rate\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rAlthough we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who\rremain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those\rleast able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level of\rjoblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women,\rand for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives\rand created great uncertainty about the future.\rThe pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in\rthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods\rprices. However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain\rparticularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run\robjective.\rAs we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is\rextraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus\rin check. The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is\rparticularly concerning. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.\rFollowing the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to\rwear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recovery\ris unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.\rThe Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote\rmaximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities\rto promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals\rand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rgoal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on\rhaving longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As we said in September\rand again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve\rinflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time\rand longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintain\ran accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are\rachieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain\rthe current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions\rhave reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and\rinflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\rIn addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury\rsecurities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace. These asset\rpurchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative\rfinancial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. At this\rmeeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing in\rsupporting the recovery. At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantial\rrate of $120 billion per month--$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of\ragency MBS. We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preserve\rfinancial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and are\rproviding substantial support to the economy. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor\rdevelopments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximum\remployment and price stability objectives, as well as market functioning and financial stability.\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rThe Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly\rsupport the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for\rstate and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to\rthe economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergency\rlending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in\rvery unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as a\rbackstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders\rthrough normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,\renabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. When\rthe time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the\rtoolbox.\rAs I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fed\rcannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities with\rbroad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will\rbe repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. But\rfor many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In these\rcases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and\rto make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. The\rfiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,\rbusinesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is the\rmost severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity\rand employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support\rfrom both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rI’d like to mention a couple of changes we plan on making to our Summary of Economic\rProjections (SEP), beginning in December. First, we will release the entire package of SEP\rmaterials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out. Previously, some of these\rmaterials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes. This step will make\rmore information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributions\rof the forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections.\rSecond, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of\runcertainty and risks have evolved over time. These changes to the SEP will provide a timely\rperspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections,\rthereby highlighting some of the risk management considerations that are relevant for monetary\rpolicy.\rTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses\racross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to\rusing our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from\rthis difficult period will be as robust as possible.\rThank you, I look forward to your questions.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","RACHAEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. It's Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.\rThanks very much for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can speak specifically about\rwhat indicators you're seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has moderated, including in\rthe labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that\rwe've seen going into flu season. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, of course, let's start with February. In February, we had an\reconomy that was performing well. Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\ractivity in March and April. And then we had a record bounce back in May and June. And so as I\rthink would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and June\rhas now moderated, so it's not unexpected. And I think if you look at just about anything, you\rknow, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just\routsized. And they're certainly still very large, but they've -- but the pace of improvement has\rmoderated. That's the case for all different measures in the labor force -- in the labor market,\rrather. Another would be claims. Just about all the data, we're showed a big bounce back. But\rthen as you would expect, when you sort of had people -- a lot of people go back to work at\ronce, the pace will moderate. Same thing with economic activity. Most forecasts call for, you\rknow, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pace\rthat we had in the third quarter. So, in a sense, that would be -- that would be as expected. We\rhave been concerned that the downside risks, though, are prevalent now, which are -- which are\rreally the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that households will run\rthrough the savings they've managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could\rweigh on activity. But what we see up to the present really is continued growth, continued\rexpansion but at a gradually moderating pace.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.\rthe stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be to\rthe economy if it does not get passed, say, before January.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. So it is -- obviously, it's for Congress to decide the timing size and\rcomponents of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by\rthe CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we've seen so far, which\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rhas generally exceeded expectations. And I do think it's likely that further support is likely to be\rneeded for monetary policy. And fiscal policy, I just mentioned the two risks that I think we face,\rand those would be well-addressed through more fiscal policy. One is the further spread of the\rvirus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people's balance\rsheets that will dwindle. But I -- you know, I think it's appropriate for us not to try to prescribe\rfor Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it\rshould be and leave it at that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE SMITH, Nick Timiraos.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. To\rfollow on Marty's question, you really have been saying since April that more is needed on the\rfiscal policy front, and yet we don't seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or the\rsummer to additional spending. Two questions: Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed\rto provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about\rthe need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is\rdiminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates. Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. So on your first question, you know, we'll take into account all\rexternal factors and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our\rgoals. That's what we will do. And I've said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better\rand move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government. And\rwe've said this in the very beginning. It's really first and foremost healthcare policy, getting the -getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics and vaccines and that\rkind of thing, getting -- so those are absolutely critical to the economy. Those are important as\rwell as health policies, they're going to be critical to the economy. Fiscal policy can do what we\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rcan, which is to replace lost incomes for people who are out of work through no fault of their\rown. And then what we can do is we can obviously support financial stability through our\rlending programs, and we can support demand through interest rates and asset purchases and that\rsort of thing. So we're going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors. So I\rthink all of us lived through the experience of the -- of the years after the global financial crisis.\rAnd for a number of years, there in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight.\rAnd I think I just would say that I think we'll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least\rsome more fiscal support when it's appropriate, you know, when it's appropriate and the size\rCongress thinks it's appropriate. I do think that that will likely -- and, by the way, you see, you\rknow, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests\rgenerally that there will be something.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick\rwas talking about, two questions about quantitative easing. The first is, if the market is\rfunctioning better as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for\rsmooth market functioning, why haven't you reduced QE that you're doing if the market is\rfunctioning better already? The second question I have is, what good for the broader economy\rwould additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don't seem to\rbe rising even above 1 percent? Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. So on the first -- the first question, it's -- our asset purchases are\rserving both purchases, both -- sorry, both purposes, financial market function and support for\reconomic activity. So -- and that's really been true -- I think in the very beginning of the crisis,\rthe main focus was, obviously, financial market function, particularly in, you know, some of the\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rmajor markets. But after that period we've understood all along that our purchases are also\rsupporting economic activity, and that's important. And that need hasn't dwindled at all. So we\rhaven't looked at reducing purchases. So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say the\rpurchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still. And, by\rthe way, they're sustaining the gains we've made in financial stability. You know, we don't -- we\rdon't take anything for granted. We don't expect that things will deteriorate. But, nonetheless, we\rhave a habit of keeping things in place for a while. So we're not taking our gains in financial\rare just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have. And, you\rknow, as you know, these, we're buying 120 billion a month. That's 1.44 trillion, if I remember\rmy times tables. And it's just providing a lot of support for economic activity and, by the way,\rremoving just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did. So this is a\rbig program, and it's doing a lot of good. And we also -- today, you know, we had a full\rdiscussion of the options around quantitative ease -- not quantitative easing, the asset purchase\rprogram and, you know, we understand the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to\rdeliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate. Right now, we think that this very\rlarge effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for\rthe markets, and so it continues.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Craig Torres, Bloomberg.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell. First, it's great to see you're okay. Chair Powell,\rwhat is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment;\rslower growth; and important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?\rAnd if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I'm wondering what's stopping the Federal\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rReserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal\rsupport we might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero\rboundary or that the economy does when we exit this. Thanks.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So you did -- you laid out nicely the risks of damage to\rthe supply side of the economy or scarring, as you put it. And we've been talking about those\rsince the very beginning of the pandemic. The risk is that, for example, people are out of the\rlabor force for an extended period of time. They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it's\rharder to get back. Your skills atrophy. It's harder to get back in. And the record is, if you don't\rget back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in. And that holds down the whole\reconomy; and, by the way, it also -- it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have\rthis happen to them at an important stage in their career. So it's important. And, you know, so\rthat is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why\rwe called this set of risks out. I don't know how we could be much more vocal about it than we\rhave been. Fortunately for -- you know, the economic recovery has exceeded certainly the\rdownside cases that we were very concerned about and even exceeded -- sort of exceeded the\rbaseline expectations. Now, that's so far. We are a long way from our goals. And, you know,\rwe're sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best. And there are parts of the\reconomy where it's going to be hard until there's a vaccine, you know, the parts of the economy.\rSo, you know, that's the supply side damage. That's sort of the third thing that we talk about. The\rfirst -- at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort. The second -- then the second part\rwas to provide support when it did expansion when it came. And the third was to avoid longerrun damage to the economy. And that's all of these things. I think we have been vocal. You\rknow, we'll try to continue to do that. And those are -- that's again, that goes to keeping this\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\repisode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary\rhousehold bankruptcies and unnecessary long-term stays of unemployment or supporting people\rthrough them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go\rback to work in a productive way.

David Gura.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","DAVID GURA. IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote a piece this week in which\rshe said, unequivocally, we're in a global liquidity trap and talked about the limits of monetary\rpolicy right now.

I don't know if you were able to pick up the pink paper and read that piece, but she\rdoes say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates below 1 percent. And I just wonder if\ryou'd agree with her in principle, that we are in a global liquidity trap and what the consequences\rof that would be. We've talked a lot about fiscal policy here domestically, and she talks about the\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rneed for sort of a global cohesive approach to fiscal policy. My second question is you talk about\rhow you follow the epidemiology. You're looking\r[ Skipping and audio breaking up].\rAnd I wanted to ask you about how you look at [skip] Christine Lagarde laying out what\rthe ECB plans to do. As you lent an ear to what she had to say, the dire warnings that she was\rmaking this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe's in, what can you and your\rcolleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you've talked about and we've all\rfeared when it comes to a policy response?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. Okay. Thanks. So two questions. First, I take the sense of your first\rquestion to be is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo, and the answer to that would be\rno, I don't think that. I think -- I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful\rtools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no\rone should have any doubt about that. And we do not doubt the power of the things that we've\ralready done or the things that we may do in the future. I do think there's more that can be done.\rI also think if you look at the stock of assets that we've bought, if you look at the facilities and\rthe way we've been able to keep accommodated financial -- financial conditions accommodative,\rI think we've been able to do a lot of things that are providing very strong support for the\reconomy. And we're going to -- we're going to keep at that. I've said -- we've said from the very\rbeginning, though, that this particular -- this particular situation we find ourselves in is one\rwhere there is a sudden loss of income on the part of millions and tens of millions of people. It's\rnot so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates\rstimulate demand, and the economy recovers. It's a sudden shock where tens of millions of\rpeople are out of work. And the fiscal response was frankly, I think, very good and very robust\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rin the United States. And it's certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as\rgood as it's been so far. So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here. You know,\rstimulating aggregate demand is one thing. But where there's a part of the economy that kind of\rwill be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy. And, of course, you need healthcare policy\rtoo. I didn't see Madame Lagarde's comments this morning, but I took the sense of that question\rto be the spread of the disease in Europe and what do we think about that? Yeah. So as I\rmentioned in my -- in my opening remarks, it's a concern. We have a widespread spike in cases\racross the country, more in some regions than others. And even if we don't have -- and I don't\rexpect that we would -- sort of government imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that\rpeople who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel,\rgoing to restaurants, going to bars and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation\rwhere suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community. So I do think\rthat that's a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and the cases spike. That could weigh on\reconomic activity. One would expect that it would. We thought the same thing, in fairness, about\rthe wave we had this summer in the South and the West. And the economy, you know, seemed\rto move right through that. This one seems to be larger and more widespread. In any case, it's a\rrisk is what I would characterize it. I would characterize it as a risk as I did in my -- in my\rcomments.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","DAVID GURA. Can I ask a quick follow-up, just about the passions of the Fed\rChairman. We've listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked about\rwhat the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it. At first you talked about the balance between\rmonetary and fiscal policy. I think in your recent comments and in Governor Brainard's\rcomments, certainly there's been more passion yet about the need for Congress to be more -- I\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rknow they're limited in what you can say or the degree to what you'd want to advise Congress,\rbut a simple question: Do you feel that you're being heard?

So let me say in the first instance, our main focus is on doing our job,\rand that is really what we're focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the\rassignment they've given us. And I think we're -- that is the thing that we think about night and\rday. I just know from the experience of the last cycle it helps to have the whole government\rworking on these things, and this one is particularly that way. And I don't -- I think -- you know,\rI don't want to say whether I feel like I'm being heard or not, but sure. I think there are plenty of\rpeople on Capitol Hill who on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill who see a need for\rfurther fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","DAVID GURA.

So what\rwould cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long-term\rsecurities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there also?

So I don't really have a specific hypothetical I would put to you. I\rwould just say that we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we\rcan shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life cycle of the program. All of\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rthose things are available to us as ways to deliver addition -- you know, more accommodation if\rwe think that's appropriate.

Thank you. Victoria Guida.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask\rabout climate change. FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need\rto account for financial change -- climate change. I'm sorry. What are you all thinking of doing\ron that front beyond what you're already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the\rnetwork for creating the financial system?\rYes. So I do think that the public will expect and has every right to expect that we -- that\rin our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all material risks and try to protect\rthe economy and the public from those risks. Climate change is one of those risks. It's a\rrelatively -- the science and art of incorporating climate change into our thinking about financial\rregulation is relatively new, as you know. And we are, you know, very actively in the early\rstages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank colleagues and other colleagues\raround the world to try to think about how this can be part of our framework. And we're\rwatching what other countries are doing. We're active participants, as you know, in the CG -- no,\rthe Greening the Financial System.

So on your first question, we really are just turning this issue now;\rand we have not made any decisions. We are just getting started on it, and it's a decision that\rwe'll make jointly with the Treasury Department. And that's really all I can say today. That's all I\rhave for you on that today. In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we\rwere worried about have subsided. And, you know, we were worried about very negative\rpotential outcomes. And that—you know, that's what is to be expected of us is to think about\rhow things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right. But we have to—we do\rmake policy from a risk management standpoint. We don't just look at the most likely case. We\rask how do you make policy in light of the risks, and often its downside risks in a situation like\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rthis. I would not say that anybody's feeling comfortable about this, though. You know, we've\rgotten through the first five, six months of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in\rEurope.

Sure. So, we have had very little demand below a million dollars in\rloans. And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that's the compensation that\rthe banks get. And there's a certain amount of work that they have to do to get into the loan\rprogram and do—and to document the thing—the loans that they make because these are loans\rthat, you know, go on their balance sheet. They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to\runderwrite the credit. And we're relying on them to some extent for doing that. And so we were\rreluctant. We moved the minimum down to 250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that. But\rwe heard over and over again that it would be great if we could reduce it to 100,000. So—and,\ryou know, we've been saying we'd have to redesign the program. And I got the question in an\roversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that. And I went back to the\roffice and thought, you know, okay. So what would that look like if we were to redesign the\rprogram in a way—it's the least thing we could do to redesign the program so that we could\rmove to a lower level? And it—basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure\rto create incentives for that. So we did that. We try to be responsive. We want, you know,\rqualifying businesses to be able to borrow. And we'll see how much demand will come. You\rknow, with these programs, why didn't we do it right away? We tend to—it's—there's more work\rthan one might—certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities. And you just try\rto get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because\ryou'll never start it if you do that. Then you get it started, and you make changes. And we've\rbeen willing to make changes. That's the most recent set of ones that we've done. And, again, we\rhope that it will help some companies, and I guess we'll find out.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you.

Would you consider some sort of credit program for\rstate and local businesses, state and local governments that are facing real budgetary pressures?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. So when I say we're not out of ammo, I'm looking at, you know, a\rcouple of our tools mainly. As I mentioned, the asset purchase program, there's a number of\rdimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate. Right now, we like the\rjob it's doing. We could, you know, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at new\rfacilities. If—you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you'd want to maybe\rcontinue the facilities and maybe change them and maybe have new ones. Who knows? But\rcertainly the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful I think overall in\raccomplishing that job. So I do think that there are things that we can do. But, remember, we've\ralways said this will take a whole of government approach including healthcare policy and fiscal\rpolicy too.

I think the\rsuccess—I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rthat whereas, you know, there were the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in\rthe muni market through mutual funds, they had withdrawn a lot of money and that we've had\rmany weeks consecutively I believe of inflows there, and you're largely back to a normal\rfunctioning market. I think that's also been a success. I think the other—certainly the funding\rthan all of them.

Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, there's a small but growing number of people\rincluding some former Fed economists who say you should find ways to go beyond your\rmandate to provide additional support to the economy which, in essence, would be fiscal support\rsince it hasn't come from Congress. One of the suggestions is buying state and municipal\rsecurities directly. Another is perhaps following the BOE and increasing asset purchases to\rsupport additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury. Is there any circumstance under\rwhich you would consider those or those would be justified? How closely are you willing to\rwork with Treasury?\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I'm going to take your question literally. And so if the\ridea is money financed fiscal policy, that's not something that we would consider. So that—what\rI mean by that is really, you know, the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the\rgovernment fairly directly. No. That's not something we do. We have different jobs. That\rknow, the job of taxation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been\relected, and that's the way it should be. There—they have to be responsible to the electorate.\rWe have a specific, you know, job to do with a specific set of tools to support maximum\remployment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks, all the\rthings we're assigned to do. But we—we're not going to get into financing the government and—\rby the way, when we buy government bonds, we don't—it doesn't actually, as you probably\rknow, doesn't change the amount of government debt outstanding. We issue a reserve to\rpurchase a Treasury security, and that's just another form. In the consolidated balance sheet of\rthe federal government, that's just another obligation. You change the—you change the, you\rknow, the nature of the obligation but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when\ryou do these asset purchase programs. So I don't know exactly what you're referring to. But, you\rknow, to—again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it's really not\rsomething that we think the central bank should do and not something we're looking at.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up, there is a suggestion that you buy state and\rmunicipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage-backed securities,\rproviding, then, cash to municipalities that are cash-strapped at this point.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIR POWELL. Well, we're doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, so\rwe're buying, you know, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that that we've\r\r\r\fNovember 5, 2020\r\rChair Powell’s Press Conference\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PRELIMINARY\r\rgotten through Congress and the Treasury. We're buying municipal securities of up to three\ryears. So we're doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3) you know,\rwhich has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly\rlaid out in the law. So we're actually doing that now. But I see that—what that is from our\rstandpoint is a rare thing that we do under Section 13(3) when regular intermediation in the\rcapital markets or in the banking system has broken down. It's no longer working. So we step in\runder 13(3) and we provide liquidity. What turns out to happen is we announce a program, and\rthe market starts working. So we only actually have to do a backstop. The amount of financing\rthat's happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year. And\rwe didn't do it. We did—we've done a very small number of loans. But just the fact that we're\rthere as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and get the\rthing where we're just another federal financing agency that's available to direct credit to—you\rknow, to very worthy borrowers. That would be more along the lines of a GSE. That's not what\rwe do. We're there to provide emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and\rthen to pull back on that when, you know—when the markets normalize, we pull back and we\rput those tools away, as we did after the global financial crisis and as we will hear when the time\rcomes.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE SMITH.

(via webcast)\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the future of economics with the next generation of economists who will shape it. I hope you will take away from what you hear today that a rigorous grounding in economic analysis can help you succeed in whatever field you choose. I will share a few thoughts on what economics can do for you and what you can do for the field of economics.1\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Let me start with what economics can do for you. Just as there are a variety of reasons that people decide to pursue economics, so too there are many career fields where a degree in economics can be a powerful enabler. I have to admit I had some reservations that led me not to major in economics as an undergraduate. That changed during my first job out of college, when I recognized that economics can provide powerful tools to analyze and design programs to improve opportunities and financial security for workers and their families.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Economics can give you a powerful framework to explore the questions that matter most to you. Let me give a few examples of some important questions and the economic practitioners who made a big impact in addressing them.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","So here's one: How can we help protect working women and men and their families from the financial devastation of job loss due to forces beyond their control? Frances Perkins first began thinking about that question as a young White girl in the manufacturing hub of Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1880s. When Frances asked her father why nice people could fall into poverty, he replied that this was a question little girls should not concern themselves with. Fortunately, Frances did not listen to him. In college, Perkins took an economics class where she started exploring the impact of rapid industrialization on the lives of working people. Her professor encouraged students to visit local factories to see firsthand some of the brutal working conditions facing women and children. That early field research sparked Perkins' determination to bring about improved working conditions and established her careful attention to gathering data.2\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Perkins went on to become a key author of the New Deal, and served as Labor Secretary for a record 12 years, despite considerable opposition to the appointment of the first woman Cabinet secretary. She persuaded Roosevelt to put in place a system of unemployment insurance and built the Labor Department's capability to compile the necessary employment statistics. She worked hard to secure legislation codifying core labor rights, and she played a key role in designing and implementing Social Security.3\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","As Perkins was advocating for policies to improve working conditions facing women and children, another young economist was gathering evidence on the lives of Black working people. In her doctoral dissertation, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander examined the living standards of Black families who were migrating to Philadelphia to meet the demand for labor brought about by World War I.4 Alexander would become the first Black American to earn a PhD in economics. She would subsequently become the first woman to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania because of the barriers she encountered in the field of economics.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Black workers were fleeing the South, Alexander explained in her dissertation, because of poor wages, segregation, lynching and disenfranchisement, seeking higher wages, better education, \"the ballot,\" and \"greater justice\" in the North. And what did those Black workers migrating to Philadelphia find? Alexander's path-breaking research showed that one-third of Black families earned less than what she defined and calculated to be a fair standard of living. About one-quarter of the Black families she studied were underfed. Keep in mind Alexander wrote this in 1921, almost 50 years before the U.S. government adopted a formal definition of the poverty level. Alexander decried the systemic discrimination in housing, education, and so much more that held Black people back in Philadelphia. And yet, Alexander was optimistic that Black workers moving North for better paying jobs would eventually attain the education and standard of living of what she called the \"Great American Middle Class.\"\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Since that time, a college degree has become more important for financial security. That raises the vitally important question of how to make college more affordable for low-income students. It turns out Lois Dickson Rice spent much of her career addressing that question. As the daughter of a janitor and a maid determined to send their five children to college, Rice was inspired by her parents' dedication to education.5 Denied an alumni club state scholarship because she was Black, Lois, with the help of her high school teachers, secured a better scholarship directly from Radcliffe.6 From there, she went on to a career at the College Board, becoming widely known as the \"mother of the Pell grant.\" Originally called the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, over almost half a century later, the program Rice designed and her tireless work to make college accessible to all, have helped around 200 million Americans afford a college education.7\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Economics can also provide powerful answers to questions such as, \"What is the cost of discrimination?\" This question was explored extensively by Andrew Brimmer, a child of sharecroppers who earned his PhD in economics at Harvard. Brimmer served with great distinction as the first Black governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1966 to 1974, where he contributed to decision-making on monetary policy, and went on to publish research on systemic risk in capital markets and the Fed's lender of last resort function.8 Brimmer estimated that discrimination cost the U.S. economy 3.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1993.9 In case you are wondering about the cost in today's economy, Dana Peterson, who is the chief economist of the Conference Board and served as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board, estimated closing racial gaps could add roughly $5 trillion to the economy over the next five years.10\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","I wanted to share these examples of pathbreaking economic scholar-practitioners who overcame daunting barriers to make important contributions on economic questions that touch the lives of working people all around our country. We created Exploring Careers in Economics to help you answer the question of whether economics is right for you. Today you will hear from my colleagues about why they chose economics, and you will learn about the many rewarding career opportunities available to you. Through our partnership with Howard University, you will see how students there are working with our economists to take a hands-on approach to research.11 I want to thank our colleagues in Federal Reserve Education for cohosting and helping to make this event available to students, educators, and groups across the nation.12\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","So that should give you a sense of what economics can do for you. What can you do for economics? You can bring your diverse backgrounds and life experiences and unique talents and interesting questions to strengthen the study and practice of economics. Economics is a powerful field that influences public policy and the economic opportunities facing all Americans. We should not be satisfied until the people in our field and those sitting around every economic decisionmaking table represent America in all its strength and diversity.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","A growing body of research and evidence makes clear that the quality of the economics profession and its contribution to society will be greater when it reflects a broader range of people and perspectives. Research shows that greater diversity results in better outcomesâit broadens the range of ideas and perspectives brought to bear on solving problems, and it brings important insights to the analysis of our economy. As Amanda Bayer and Cecilia Rouse have documented, microeconomic experiments and other research demonstrate the benefits of diversity for group deliberations and decisionmaking. For instance, one well-known experiment found that racially diverse groups of students outperformed other groups in solving problems, and another found similar benefits from gender diversity.13 A review of 2.5 million research papers across the sciences found that those written by ethnically diverse research teams received more citations and had a greater impact than papers by authors with the same ethnicity.14\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","It is notable that when Congress established the Federal Reserve System, it took great care to ensure that there would be a diversity of perspectives around the decisionmaking table with regard to regional representation. That is why we have 12 Reserve Bank Districts represented on the Federal Open Market Committee. But we have not yet lived up to that standard on racial and ethnic diversity. For instance, it was not until 2017, more than 100 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve, that the first African American, Raphael Bostic, was chosen to lead a Reserve Bank.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","We need to address the stubbornly persistent gap in the awarding of economics degrees.15 Among U.S. citizens and permanent residents earning a doctorate in economics from U.S. universities, the representation of those identifying as Black, Hispanic, or Native American was 10 percent in 2018. The share of women overall obtaining a doctorate in economics was slightly above 30 percent in 2018, little changed from 1994. By contrast, Blacks and Hispanics make up 13 percent of medical students and women overall make up just over half of all medical students in the country.16 Economics also lags behind law as well as science and engineering in the share of underrepresented minorities and women receiving advanced degrees. But the gap starts at the undergraduate level, as highlighted by Rhonda Sharpe.17 From 2011 to 2015, Black women accounted for only 1.5 percent of undergraduate economics degrees, compared with their 6.2 percent share of all undergraduate degrees.18\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Diversity and inclusion need to be priorities for every economics department around the countryâand for the think tanks, governments, businesses, and many other organizations that train and employ economists. Many of my colleagues in economics and education are working hard to make progress, including by developing programs to support and mentor diverse talent interested in this consequential discipline. We need to make it a national goal to catch up to medicine, science, engineering, and other fields in developing robust programs, conducting ongoing evaluation, and constantly adapting to improve the inclusivity of economics and our ability to recruit and retain diverse talent. We want to be known within the profession as a place where minorities and women are confident they have the opportunity to make an impact and feel they are respected and heard by leadership.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","We must continue to make progress towards a more just society, and I am hopeful that economists will contribute to that progress. Studying economics will provide you with a powerful, intellectual framework for asking and answering questions that matter to you. It will enable you to influence people's lives for the better. It will enable you to craft policy to change our world. It will enable you to teach and help shape the next generation.

It prompted a sharp and global flight from riskier, more volatile asset classes, and a retreat to the safety of cash. That retreat demanded immediate, extraordinary, and concerted public intervention, to ensure stability, restore calm, and see the nation through an unfolding crisis.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","For the Federal Reserve, that intervention spanned a wide range of financial intermediaries and markets, including the banking sector.2 Strengthened by a decade of improvements in capital, liquidity, and risk management, including the refinement and recalibration of the last three years, banking organizations became an important shelter from financial distress. Our goal was to ensure this shelter stood fastâthat banks could respond to the emergency, and address consumer, business, and community needs, without jeopardizing their own safety and soundness.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The report accompanying my testimony lists these actions in detail, and we have extended several of them as the COVID event has continued.3 They range from temporary adjustments to capital and reserve measures, to temporary changes in compliance requirements, to temporary shifts toward off-site examination activities, to temporary delays in the implementation of new standards. They include specific guidance on the use of capital and liquidity buffers. They clarify, beyond doubt, that safety and soundness are no impediment to working constructively with customers, including borrowers, in a time of strain.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Together with monetary, financial stability, and fiscal actions, these measures helped calm the waters. The initial wave of market stress has passed, and the recovery has begun much sooner than expected. This speaks to the country's tenacity, ingenuity, and spirit in responding to even the greatest of shocks.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The challenge we face now is distinct, formidable, and complex. The surprise of the COVID event is gone, replaced by a clearer view of its economic consequences. The burdens facing households and businesses are better understood, but they are no less significant, and they are not evenly borne. I am confident that we will work through them together, support those hardest hit, and ensure that our economic wounds do not become scars.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The Federal Reserve remains committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy for as long as needed, and a strong, resilient banking system is an essential element of such support. A durable recovery demands banks that lend actively, confront gains and losses honestly, withstand unexpected shocks, and help customers rebuild and adapt to the new landscape. Our task, as supervisors, is to ensure the country's banks continue to meet that exacting standard.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","The Federal Reserve's earliest COVID-related guidance, encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers, was an important step toward this goal. Since then, working with our colleagues in other financial regulatory agencies, we have taken several others:\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","We also used the flexibility in our stress-testing apparatus to better understand the effects of the COVID-event shock.8 This framework, like the data associated with it, has long been a key part of day-to-day banking supervision. However, it was born in and built for a crisis, to cut through panic, clarify the health of the largest financial firms, and provide the certainty needed to restore confidence.9 In that spirit, and under the constraints of a fast-moving market event, we conducted and published a \"sensitivity analysis,\" examining how institutions would fare in a prolonged downturn. The banking system remained well capitalized in the downside scenarios we examined. But in light of continuing uncertainty, we took several steps to preserve bank capitalâand with it, banks' role as a source of economic strength.10 We are conducting a second round of stress tests toward that same goal, with results announced before the end of this year.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","As our report shows, that strength is still intact. Liquidity and capital remain high and, indeed, have increased at our largest banks over the course of the COVID event. Firms have sharply increased their reserves, setting aside resources today against losses they may incur tomorrow. Banks are well positioned to serve as a bulwark against broader financial and economic stress.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","It is worth recognizing how things might have been different. This foundation would not exist, after a once-in-a-century shock, if not for a decade of work by officials and the banks themselves to make banks stronger and more stable, and to make banking supervision fairer, more efficient, and more transparent. Those values are not contingent, fit only for an economic boom. They represent an ethic and a commitmentâto addressing the most pressing supervisory and regulatory issues in the most effective waysâthat are even more critical during a crisis.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","That ethic has steered the Federal Reserve through the last seven months, and it will continue to guide us through the recovery. It applies to our efforts to complete the implementation of Basel III reforms like the net stable funding ratio, tailoring them to the activities and risks of different institutions. It applies to our recent work to streamline the Volcker rule and swap margin rule.11 It applies to our assessment of the lessons of the COVID-event shock, understanding which parts of our regulatory framework functioned well and which need improvement.12 It applies to our international engagement, to ensure that global financial rules do not splinter and fragment as we gradually return to normal.13\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","COVID-19 changed many aspects of the Federal Reserve's work. It also affirmed the values and priorities that remain the sameâthose that will continue to guide us in our support for the financial system, the economy, and the country, long after the COVID event has passed.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","Thank you for your time. I look forward to answering your questions.\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","1. Randal K.

Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome.\rIn my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open\rour policy strategy. I will then be glad to take your questions.\rAs indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that\rwere initiated at previous meetings. In particular, the Committee is keeping the target range for\rthe federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are\rlikely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.\rThe Committee will continue the program that we announced in September to extend the\raverage maturity of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities by purchasing longer-term\rTreasury securities and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasury securities. Our\rpurchases of longer-term securities exert downward pressures on longer-term interest rates; at the\rsame time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of\rour sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest rates. Consequently, this maturity\rextension program should foster more accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping\rsupport a stronger recovery without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance\rsheet. In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our\rpreviously announced program in which the principal payments from our holdings of agency\rdebt and agency mortgage-backed securities are being reinvested in agency MBS. The\rCommittee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we are\rprepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.\r\r1 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rIn conjunction with today’s meeting, the FOMC participants submitted projections for\reconomic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and\rover the longer run. The central tendencies and ranges of those projections are depicted in the\rfigures that have been distributed. The longer-run projections—shown at the right side of each\rfigure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over\rtime, assuming appropriate monetary policy and no further shocks to the economy.\rThe longer-run projections for growth of real GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to\r2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of\r5.2 to 6.0 percent. These projections can be interpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates\rof the economy’s normal or trend rate of growth and its normal unemployment rate over the\rlonger run. Because the economy's longer- run normal rates of output growth and\runemployment are determined largely by nonmonetary factors that may evolve over time and\rthat cannot often be directly measured, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to\rrevision.\rThe central tendency of the longer-run projections for inflation, as measured by the price\rindex for personal consumption expenditures, is 1.7 to 2.0 percent. The inflation outlook over\rthe longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections\ressentially reflect participants’ judgments about the inflation rate that is most consistent with the\rFederal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum employment and stable prices. In effect, the\r“mandate-consistent” inflation rate is judged to be 2 percent or a bit less.\rI turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook. Participants’ projections for real GDP\rfor 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent. Output growth strengthened\rduring the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on\r\r2 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rgrowth earlier in the year. In particular, global supply chain disruptions associated with the\rnatural disaster in Japan have diminished. Moreover, the prices of oil and other commodities\rhave come down from their peaks, easing strains on household budgets and contributing to a\rsomewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.\rThe Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters,\rreflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tight credit conditions for many\rhouseholds and smaller businesses, volatility in financial markets, fiscal consolidation at all\rlevels of government, and other factors. Looking further ahead, economic growth is expected to\rpick up somewhat as a result of improving financial conditions, strengthening consumer and\rbusiness confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.\rSpecifically, the central tendency of participants’ growth projections picks up gradually from\r2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.\rIn light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects\rthat the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quarters. Participants’\rprojections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of\r8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ percentage point lower than the latest monthly reading of\r9.1 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the\rfourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of\runemployment.\rIn short, while we still expect that economic activity and labor market conditions will\rimprove gradually over time, the pace of progress is likely to be frustratingly slow. Moreover,\rthere are significant downside risks to the economic outlook. Most notably, concerns about\rEuropean fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which\r\r3 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rhave likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth. European leaders have recently\rannounced a number of steps to address those issues. We will continue to monitor European\rdevelopments closely.\rI’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation. The prices of oil and other commodities rose\rsharply earlier this year. Consumer inflation consequently picked up over the first half of 2011,\rreflecting higher prices of gasoline, food, and other goods and services for which producers\rpassed higher input costs along to their customers. In addition, prices of motor vehicles surged\rin response to the global supply disruptions associated with the disaster in Japan. However,\rinflation appears to have moderated as those transitory influences have waned, and as low levels\rof resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages. Furthermore, survey measures and\rConsequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle\rat or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 percent or a bit less. Specifically, the central\rtendency of participants’ inflation projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to\r1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014. The Committee will continue to\rpay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.\rThe current economic outlook provides important context for understanding today’s\rpolicy decision. The Committee’s mandate from the Congress is to seek maximum employment\rand price stability. With unemployment well above normal levels and expected to decline only\rslowly, and with inflation expected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the\rCommittee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy\raccommodation. We will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming\r\r4 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rinformation, and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to promote a stronger\reconomic recovery in a context of price stability.\rFinally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy\rpublic communications. Specifically, we have been engaging in a series of discussions about\rpotential approaches to providing the public additional information about our monetary policy\rgoals and policy strategy, as well as about our outlook for the economy and for the future stance\rof monetary policy. However, no decisions about such approaches were made at this meeting.\rThank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, it seems there’s been\rincreasing criticism of the Fed’s policy. You received a letter on the eve of the September\rmeeting urging you not to take action from the GOP leadership. Several GOP presidential\rcandidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates. On the first issue, do you feel that crossed\rthe line? Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence? On the second\rquestion, what are the GOP presidential candidates not hearing or understanding about Fed\rpolicy, in your opinion?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to\rstay nonpartisan and out of those debates. I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S.\reconomy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price\rstability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short\rterm, it’s very important that the Fed be free from political pressures. And therefore, we are\rgoing to make our decisions based on what’s good for the economy, and we’re not going to take\rany politics into account.\r\r5 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rNow, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed’s highly\rexpansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk. I would simply point to the record.\rIf you look back for the last five years, inflation—although it’s been volatile because of\rcommodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable\rdefinition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the\runemployment side. So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far,\rat least, not proved to be very valid.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","STEVE LIESMAN. Was the letter appropriate?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I’m not going to comment on that. I—we listen to\reverybody’s input, and the most important thing is that we are free to make the decision based on\rthe interest of the American people, what’s in the interest of the economy, and that’s what we’re\rgoing to do.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Has the Fed discussed the idea of nominal GDP targeting?\rAnd what are your views on the advantages and disadvantages of that approach?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So the Fed’s mandate is, of course, a dual mandate. We\rhave a mandate for both employment and for price stability, and we have a framework in place\rthat allows us to communicate and to think about the two sides of that mandate. We talked\rtoday—or yesterday, actually—about nominal GDP as an indicator, as an information variable,\ras something to add to the list of variables that we think about, and it was a very interesting\rdiscussion. However, we think that within the existing framework that we have, which looks at\rboth sides of the mandate, not just some combination of the two, we can communicate whatever\rwe need to communicate about future monetary policy. So we are not contemplating at this\r\r6 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rdate—at this time—any radical change in framework. We are going to stay within the dualmandate approach that we’ve been using until this point.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","JENNIFER LIBERTO. Chairman, you’ve said in the past you understand some of the\ranger on display with the Occupy Wall Street protesters. And a lot of the anger is directed at the\rFed, with some protesters saying that the Fed is part of the problem, that the Fed preserves the\rfinancial system and promotes income inequality. Can—are the protesters right? Is the Fed part\rof the problem? And, secondarily, can the Fed do anything to promote a more equitable\reconomy?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, as I’ve said before, I certainly understand that many\rpeople are dissatisfied with the state of the economy. I’m dissatisfied with the state of the\reconomy. Unemployment is far too high. Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been\rgoing on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that\rhas continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past. So again, I fully\rsympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be,\rand in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectrum are understandable.\rI think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions. The Federal\rReserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the financial system in 2008 and 2009. A\rvery simplistic interpretation of that was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve,\ryou know, bankers’ salaries. That is obviously not the case. What we were doing is trying to\rprotect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collapse of both the financial system\rand the American economy. We needed to take those steps. If we hadn’t taken them, the\rconsequences would have been dire. And not everybody understands that, and therefore they\rsometimes misunderstand our motives. Our motives are strictly to do what’s in the interest of\r\r7 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rthe broad public, and I believe that our efforts to stabilize the financial system, which ultimately\rproved successful, were very much in the interest of the broad public.\rWith respect to the current economy, as I described earlier, we are currently continuing\rwith our accommodative monetary policy. We are trying to do our best to support economic\rgrowth and job creation. I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from some other\rparts of the government to work with us, to help create more jobs. But certainly, we are doing\rour part to try to create more jobs and more opportunities in America.\rWith respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs. It\rgives people opportunities. It gives people a chance to earn income, gain experience, and to\rultimately earn more. But that’s an indirect approach; that’s really the only way the Fed can\raddress inequality per se.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","JON HILSENRATH. Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Chairman, the\rFed’s forecast for 2013 shows the unemployment rate finishing the year between 7.8 and\r8.2 percent. The statement says that short-term rates will stay near their current levels at least\rthrough mid-2013. Does that suggest that the Fed could conceive of raising short-term interest\rrates before unemployment even gets to 8 percent or much lower? And if not, could you explain\rhow people should interpret those two messages?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the statement says “at least” mid-2013. So, clearly, it\rcould well be some point beyond that, and markets are currently anticipating a somewhat later\rliftoff. One of the things we discussed yesterday in our communications discussion was how we\rmight further clarify that part of the statement and try to provide more information about what\rconditions would prevail at the time that we would be considering raising rates. But we haven’t\rcome to that point yet, but we certainly would like to provide more clarity about that. But again,\r\r8 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rlet me emphasize that what we are saying now is “at least”; there’s no implication that we would\rnecessarily move in mid-2013 with those conditions prevailing that you described.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PEDRO DACOSTA. Pedro DaCosta from Reuters. Mr. Chairman, what is your appetite\rfor a renewed push into large-scale mortgage-backed securities purchases? The Fed had stated\rthe intention to move the structure of its balance sheet more to its original, you know, Treasuriesonly composition. But recently, it revived the MBS program through the reinvestments, and\rfolks like Governor Tarullo and William Dudley have raised the possibility of further large-scale\rasset purchases on the MBS side. Could you comment on your views on that particular\rproposal?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, I’ll be glad to. You were absolutely correct—first,\rthat ultimately we would like to return our portfolio to Treasuries only. That may be some time\rdown the road at this point. You’re also correct that as part of our policy action at the last\rmeeting, we began to reinvest mortgage-backed securities and agency debt back into\rmortgage-backed securities, thereby providing some additional support for the mortgage market.\rThe housing sector is a very important sector. It’s—the problems in that sector are clearly a big\rreason why our economy is not recovering more quickly. So I do think that purchases of\rmortgage-backed securities is a viable option. It’s certainly something we would consider if\rconditions were appropriate. So the answer is yes, we would certainly look at that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","GREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com. At the\rmoment now, banks are holding hundreds of billions of dollars in excess reserves, and at the\rsame time, corporations seem to be holding lots of cash on the—and foreigners—at the same\rtime, foreigners keep investing a lot of money in the United States. The current account deficit\r\r9 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\ris very large. Could you shed some light on that situation? Is there something that foreigners\rknow that U.S. companies don’t about investing in the U.S.?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, most of the—a great deal of the investment in the\rU.S. takes the form of purchases of U.S. government debt in Treasury securities. And that, in\rturn, reflects the desire for the liquidity and safety provided by the U.S. Treasury market. For\rexample, as you know, two of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury securities are China and\rJapan, who hold those securities primarily as foreign exchange reserves and, in the case of\rChina, in an effort to keep their exchange rate from appreciating too quickly. So, I was—while\rit’s good that foreign central banks and so on have the confidence to buy U.S. Treasuries, it’s not\rquite the same as investing in plant and equipment. We’ve seen a little bit of improvement there,\rbut it’s still obviously too low to be consistent with a full employment economy.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PETER BARNES. Peter Barnes, Fox Business. Sir, could you comment on the failure of\rMF Global, which is a primary dealer? And specifically, the Financial Times is reporting that\rthe leverage ratio at MF Global was 40 to 1. Were you aware of that? Did the Fed approve of\rthat? Is that an acceptable leverage ratio, particularly since the financial crisis?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly. The New York Federal Reserve Bank approved\rMF Global to be a primary dealer; I believe it was in February of this year. At that time, the\rcompany met the criteria that had been set forth in terms of management, financial condition,\rcapacity, and so on to qualify to be a primary dealer. We have set those standards in a way that\rwould allow smaller firms like MF Global to participate in the primary dealer market. But I\rwould like to emphasize, I guess, a couple of points. First, we are not the regulators of MF\rGlobal. That’s done by the SEC and the CFTC, so we do not have ongoing insight into\rdevelopments within the company. And secondly, again, making them a primary dealer did not\r\r10 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rin any way constitute a seal of approval. In fact, the New York Fed’s website contains a\rstatement pretty much to that effect. So, they were a primary dealer, we stopped trading with\rthem before they failed, and we’ve suffered no losses or other consequences from our\rtransactions with the company. Again, in terms of your question about leverage and financial\rcondition, the company declined very, very quickly based on, apparently, a small number of\rlarge bets. As far as I know we were not aware of that, but again, to emphasize, we were not—\rwe are not the overseers, the regulators of that company.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","PEDRO DACOSTA. Can I just ask whether you see it as an isolated case or whether this\ris the start of something broader?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The question is, Was that an isolated case? It appears to be\ran idiosyncratic case, and we’re monitoring the possible impacts on funding markets and\relsewhere. And, so far, we’ve not seen any significant impact on financial stability.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","JON HILSENRATH. To follow up on that question, should the Fed be, on an ongoing\rbasis, monitoring its primary dealers?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The question is, Should the Fed be monitoring its primary\rdealers? Only if the Fed is the supervisor. In this case, the combination of a\rbroker–dealer and a futures commission merchant imply that the SEC and the CFTC are the\rappropriate supervisors. They would not have qualified—this company would not have qualified\ras a SIFI under the provisional guidance issued by the FSOC, so there’s no basis at this point for\rthe Fed to be the overseer of that, of those companies.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","NEIL IRWIN. Neil Irwin with the Washington Post. Mr. Chairman, this is the third\rstraight set of economic projections you’ve released that have downgraded forecasts for growth\rand for employment. I wonder, is there some systematic error, some blind spot that’s behind\r\r11 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rthese, kind of, overly optimistic forecasts? What are you doing internally to understand what\ryou got wrong the last few projections?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it’s a perfectly fair question. And, you know, we\rspend a lot of time reviewing those errors. The staff, in particular, presents us with information\ron forecast errors and on revisions, et cetera, and so we look at that very carefully. I think it’s\rclear that—in retrospect, that the severity of the financial crisis and a number of other problems,\rincluding the dysfunction of the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than\rwe initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by\rthe household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery. So, yes, we have again\rdowngraded the medium-term forecast. Evidently, the forces—you know, the drags on the\rrecovery were stronger than we thought.\rI would add, however, though, that although I think it’s very important to look at the\rfundamental factors affecting the recovery, there’ve been some elements of bad luck. For\rexample, this year, the combination of the natural disaster in Japan which had global impacts in\rterms of growth, oil price increases, the European debt crisis, which was not anticipated to be as\rsevere and create as much volatility as it has in financial markets—all those things have been\rnegatives for growth, and they do explain at least part of the downward revision.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Television. Many Americans\rwonder what the Fed has actually accomplished with its monetary policy actions since about\rQE2. Fed officials like to talk about the effect they’ve had on interest rates, but the economy\rseems insensitive to interest rates these days. Can you explain what you have managed to\raccomplish? Can you tell us whether you feel your mandate requires you to do anything you can\rthink of on an ongoing basis until some targets are met? And can you explain to the average\r\r12 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rAmerican why you’re doing what you’re doing? And do you think that you risk credibility if the\raverage American doesn’t see some sort of improvement in the economy?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, it’s a fair question. I would first say that monetary\rpolicy is having effects on the economy. And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but\rwe have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions\rlike investment or car purchases. One area where monetary policy has been blunted—the effects\rhave been blunted—has been the mortgage market, where very tight credit standards have\rprevented many people from purchasing or refinancing their homes, and therefore the low\rmortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been as effective as we had hoped. So, monetary\rpolicy may be somewhat less powerful in the current context than it has been in the past, but\rnevertheless, it is affecting economic growth and job creation.\rIf you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one,\rwhich is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the\rproblems of high inflation but also very importantly has avoided the risk of deflation. And\rwe’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem\rand very difficult to get out of once you are there. So we have been able to achieve, on average,\rstable prices.\rWith respect to growth, I think that our policies, including the cutting of rates to zero in\rwere very important for helping to explain why the economy stopped contracting and began to\rgrow again in the middle of 2009. I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth\rand job creation. I would argue that we’ve also been successful with some of the later actions\rthat we’ve taken, although it’s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we\r\r13 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\ralways face the problem of asking the question, Well, where would we be without these policies?\rAnd our best estimates are that—absent the support of monetary policy, that the economy would\rbe in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher than it is. That being\rsaid, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to\rwhere we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable. Yes, I do think that\rwith—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price\rstability and maximum employment. We’ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have\rare efficacious and that they don’t have costs or risks or negative side effects that are worse than\rthe benefits. We’ll always be making that evaluation.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","GREG IP. Greg Ip with the Economist. In response to Pedro’s question, you said you\rwould consider more MBS purchases when the conditions were appropriate. Could you\relaborate on what conditions would be appropriate to do additional large-scale asset purchases,\rwhat your reaction function is right now?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I don’t think I can be as precise as you would like.\rI—the MBS purchases and Treasury securities purchases are one set of tools that we have. The\rother set of tools that we have are communication tools, which essentially tie interest rate\rare basically the two tools that we have, and we need to continue to work on how best to use\rthem and in what combination to use them to achieve our objectives.\rIn terms of when we would use these, I think all I can say is that the Committee will have\rto look at the outlook, and if it judges that we are falling sufficiently far short of our objectives in\rterms of inflation falling at or below its target and growth being insufficient, and that we believe\rthat monetary stimulus would be beneficial, you know, then the Committee obviously would try\r\r14 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rto take corrective action. But I can’t—you know, it’s a Committee decision, we’ll have to look\rat the outlook.

Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg. Your colleague Daniel Tarullo\rphrased this as, “Further action would be required in the absence of favorable developments.”\rDoes that mean that, looking at the forecast tables we have here today, that if we don’t see\rimprovement from what’s in those tables, that further action would be required?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Again, I can’t speak for my colleagues on the Committee. I\rwill say that that forecast we have is satisfactory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation\rremains low and stable, but it is very unsatisfactory in terms of the rate of growth of the\reconomy, the rate at which unemployment comes down. So I think the judgment we’re going to\rhave to make is, do the tools we have—are those tools likely to be sufficiently effective? Or do\rthey bear costs and risks that would make them less effective or not worth using? So it’s a\rjudgment we’re going to have to continue to make. We’re going to have to continue to evaluate\rthe outlook.

Well, we are committed to, and are in the process of,\rimplementing Basel III, which has a basic requirement including a buffer of 7 percent, and then\radditional surcharges for the largest institutions. We think that’s an appropriate framework. I’m\rnot sure that the 9 percent that Europeans are talking about is really comparable to this, to the\rcapital requirements that we are imposing, or will be imposing, on U.S. banks. For example, the\rcomposition of their capital is not, as far as I understand, purely common equity. I do not know\rwhat risk weights are being applied to the assets. So there are a number of questions of\rcomparability. My expectation and hope is that—over the medium term, that the Europeans who\ragreed to the Basel III conditions will ensure that their banks meet the Basel III standards over\rtime. Of course, that’s being phased in over a number of years so as not to jeopardize in any way\rthe recovery. But, over the remainder of this decade, we anticipate implementing all of the key\relements of Basel III in the United States.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","LUCA DILEO. Luca DiLeo with Dow Jones. Mr. Chairman, you’ve partly addressed\rthis, but there’s something I still fail to understand. Given that your forecast is still so gloomy\rfor employment through 2014, given that you’re not worried about inflation, and given that you\rsaid that MBS is a viable option, why not act today?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory\rone in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow. We have taken a lot of\ractions. Let me be very clear that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly\raccommodative now—we brought rates close to zero, we have done $2 trillion worth of asset\rpurchases, we have made commitments about rates, we’ve extended the maturity of our\rportfolio—so we have taken a lot of steps, including steps at the last two meetings, so we are\rbeing very aggressive in providing monetary accommodation. I was asked before about\r\r16 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rconditions for further accommodation. Well, we are prepared to do that, and we will continue to\robserve, you know, how the economy evolves. You know, what we have is a projection; there’s\ra lot of uncertainty there. And so it will be very important to see, you know, what actually\rhappens in terms of financial market conditions and economic growth. So, but we are prepared\rto take further action. We’ve already taken quite a bit of action, but we’re prepared to do more,\rand we have the tools to do more if that’s appropriate. Again, while I do not shirk the\rresponsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously, a broad range\rof policies can affect growth and employment, and I hope that there will be a range of actions\rthat will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve’s efforts.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","JIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the LA Times. You mentioned before\rthe streak of bad luck that struck the economy earlier this year. With the latest developments in\rEurope this week, where the debt deal seemingly was done and now the rug was pulled out, are\ryou getting the sense that this economy just can’t catch a break? And how would you advise\raverage Americans to deal with these continued shocks to the economy and to the financial\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, I don’t want to make excuses. Again, we did\roverestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I\rmentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repair, the state of the housing market, and so on.\rBut that being said, as I indicated earlier, there has been a certain amount of bad luck, and I think\rthe volatility in financial markets associated with the European situation has been—along with\rvolatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions, has been a drag on recovery. I think it’s part\rof the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at\rthe last press conference in June. So there has been that concern. It’s showing up in Americans’\r\r17 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rconfidence and sentiment. You can see that right now consumer confidence is about where it\rwas in the depths of recession; that’s very discouraging. To some extent, at least, it will be a\rdrag on consumer’s willingness to spend and to invest.\rMy best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to\rthink about your personal situation and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial\rposition. Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they’re trying to pay\rdown debt. That’s, of course, important. At the same time, you want to make smart decisions,\ryou want to make good investments, you want to budget properly. So financial literacy is a big\rpart of this, and lack of financial literacy was one of the things that got us into this mess in the\rfirst place. So I would advise people to try to be smart about their finances. Unfortunately, we\rcan’t disassociate ourselves from Europe; the things that are happening there do affect us, and\rthat’s an unfortunate fact. I hope very much that the Europeans will find a set of solutions that\rwill allow markets to calm down and take off some of the headwinds from the U.S. economy.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","ROBIN HARDING. Robin Harding from the Financial Times. Mr. Chairman, could\ryou explain the menu of options that the Committee has for improving its communication about\rwhen it might raise interest rates and what the conditions are in which it might do that? For\rexample, might it makes sense for the Fed to publish a forecast of its own future interest rates,\rand what’s the advantages and disadvantages of that? Thank you.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, again, as I noted in my opening remarks, no decisions\rhave been made, so I want to be very clear that no final—you know, there is no final outcome\rhere in this discussion. But clearly, there’s a range of things that we can do. We can provide\rmore information about our objectives, for example. We could provide information about where\rwe want inflation to be in the long term, for example. We can also provide information about the\r\r18 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rfuture path of interest rates, which we’ve done to some extent via our “mid-2013” language in\rthe statement. An alternative approach, which Charlie Evans and others have suggested, is to tie\rthat to economic conditions and to provide more information about under what circumstances we\rwould raise rates. That is certainly something that we have discussed and I think is an interesting\ralternative. There’s a lot of interest in using the survey of economic projections in constructive\rways as we have up until now to provide information to the public about our plans. And in\rparticular, using the SEP as a way of giving information about our future policy decisions is\rsomething that’s on the table. There’s no decision made about that, but that’s one direction that\rwe might find productive.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MICHELLE FLEURY. Michelle Fleury, BBC News. You mentioned, obviously, that\rEurope and what’s happening there has an impact here on the U.S. economy. To what degree\rcan the Fed do little more than react to events abroad?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it is a bit frustrating. Obviously, the key\rultimately it’s their responsibility to find solutions to this very difficult problem. Of course, I\rand the Treasury Secretary and other economic policymakers in United States do confer and\rmeet with European policymakers on a regular basis, and we give our advice, for what it’s\rworth—sometimes they take it, sometimes they don’t. But, obviously, they’re the ones who\rhave to make those decisions. So what we can do, really, is only a couple of things. One is that\rwe can look at our own financial institutions and try to assess the exposures and the linkages\rbetween our institutions and those in Europe and the sovereign debt in Europe, and we’ve been\rdoing that on a consistent basis. We’ve looked also, of course, with other regulators at money\r\r19 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rSo that’s one thing that we can do. And the other thing that we can do is stand ready, if\rnecessary, to provide whatever support the broader economy needs and the financial system\rneeds, should things worsen. I mean, we are hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously\rimplemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these stresses, but in the case that things do get\rworse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the\rU.S. economy from the effects.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","KATHERINE LEWIS. Hi, Katherine Lewis for Bankrate.com. Can you talk about what\rimpact you’ve seen from Operation Twist on longer-term CD rates and investment-grade bond\ryields? And do you have any message for people who are relying on those kinds of instruments\rfor income?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure. It’s a little bit early to fully assess the effects of what\rwe call the maturity extension program. But it does seem to be having, at least in a preliminary\rsense—it does seem to be having the intended effect of lowering longer-term interest rates and\rtwisting the yield curve, as was anticipated. That, in turn, should lead to still lower mortgage\rrates and other interest rates which are relevant to the economy. We are quite aware that very\rlow interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have costs for a lot of people. They\rhave costs for savers. We have complaints from banks that complain that their net interest\ra protracted period require them to make larger contributions. So we are aware of those\rconcerns, and we take them very seriously.\rI think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and\rrecovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we’ve been keeping monetary policy\rconditions accommodative, trying to support the recovery, trying to support job creation. After\r\r20 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rall, savers are not going to get very good returns in an economy which is in a deep recession. I\rmean, ultimately, if you want to earn money on your investments, you have to invest in an\reconomy which is growing. And so, we believe that our policy will ultimately benefit not just\rworkers and firms and households in general, but will benefit savers as well, as the returns that\rthey can earn on their investments will improve with the improvement in the economy.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","DARREN GERSH. Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report. Given how hard it has been\rto bring down unemployment in the past, why are you confident you have the tools to bring it\rdown in the future?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and\raccommodation. We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what\reconomists would call cyclical unemployment—that is, unemployment arising because of\rinadequate demand in the economy. If that’s the case, then a monetary policy—by lowering\rinterest rates, making financial conditions more accommodative—should stimulate demand,\rshould stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical\runemployment. That is something that we know from a lot of experience, and, although it’s\rbeen a very slow process here, there’s no reason to think that the same basic effect will not work\rin this case as well.\rNow, it’s also possible that part of the increase in unemployment reflects so-called\rstructural factors—mismatches between worker skills and job opportunities, loss of skills,\rgeographical mismatch, et cetera. And to the extent that that’s the case, then monetary policy is\rmuch less effective because in that case, only other kinds of labor market policies really can\rmake progress against that type of unemployment. But again, I do think that a considerable part\rof the unemployment that we are seeing is cyclical and is thus amenable to monetary policy.\r\r21 of 22\r\r\fNovember 2, 2011\r\rChairman Bernanke’s Press Conference\r\rFINAL\r\rFinal comment: Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can\rbecome structural unemployment as people lose skills, as they lose attachment to the labor force,\ras their work networks dry up and so on. So in that respect, it’s important for us to try to address\rthe unemployment problem in a sense while it’s still amenable to monetary policy.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","BRAIMOH ODION-ESENE. Braimoh Odion-Esene, Market News International. You\rmentioned that the Fed has the tools and stands ready to use it. But given that in the statement it\rsays that the Committee saw growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, is it fair to say\rthat the FOMC is less aggressively considering more policy accommodation, given the\rimprovement they saw in the third quarter?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We did see some improvement in the third quarter, a\rmodest improvement. We saw, for example, stronger consumption spending, a reasonable\ramount of capital investment, lower inventories, therefore suggesting more production in the\rfourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter as well will be a moderate-growth quarter. So\rthere was some improvement—some improvement, at least early in the period, in financial\racknowledging in our statement, that’s true. But as has been noted, the medium-term outlook\rrelative to our June projections has been downgraded, and the outlook remains unsatisfactory\rover the next few years.

The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and thoseleast able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, the high level ofjoblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers in the services sector, for women,and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many livesand created great uncertainty about the future.The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines inthe spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goodsprices. However, for those sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remainparticularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-runobjective.As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy isextraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virusin check. The recent rise in new COVID-19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, isparticularly concerning. All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and towear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength. A full economic recoveryis unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promotemaximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilitiesto promote the stability of the financial system. As noted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goalsand Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive\fNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press Conference\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYgoal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly onhaving longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. As we said in Septemberand again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieveinflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over timeand longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. We expect to maintainan accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes areachieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintainthe current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditionshave reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment andinflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasurysecurities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace. These assetpurchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodativefinancial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. At thismeeting, my colleagues and I discussed our asset purchases and the role they are playing insupporting the recovery. At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantialrate of $120 billion per month--$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month ofagency MBS. We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preservefinancial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and areproviding substantial support to the economy. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitordevelopments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximumemployment and price stability objectives, as well as market functioning and financial stability.\fNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press Conference\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYThe Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directlysupport the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and forstate and local governments. Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage tothe economy and promoting a robust recovery. Many of our programs rely on emergencylending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only invery unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. These programs serve as abackstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lendersthrough normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Whenthe time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in thetoolbox.As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers. The Fedcannot grant money to particular beneficiaries. We can only create programs or facilities withbroad-based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans willbe repaid. Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy. Butfor many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer. In thesecases, direct fiscal support may be needed. Elected officials have the power to tax and spend andto make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources. Thefiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families,businesses, and communities across the country. Even so, the current economic downturn is themost severe in our lifetimes. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activityand employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued supportfrom both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.\fNovember 5, 2020Chair Powell’s Press Conference\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYI’d like to mention a couple of changes we plan on making to our Summary of EconomicProjections (SEP), beginning in December. First, we will release the entire package of SEPmaterials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out. Previously, some of thesematerials were released three weeks after the meeting as part of the minutes. This step will makemore information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributionsof the forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections.Second, we will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments ofuncertainty and risks have evolved over time. These changes to the SEP will provide a timelyperspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections,thereby highlighting some of the risk management considerations that are relevant for monetarypolicy.To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businessesacross the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.

And then we had a record bounce back in May and June. And so as Ithink would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and Junehas now moderated, so it's not unexpected. And I think if you look at just about anything, youknow, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were justoutsized. And they're certainly still very large, but they've -- but the pace of improvement hasmoderated. That's the case for all different measures in the labor force -- in the labor market,rather. Another would be claims. Just about all the data, we're showed a big bounce back. Butthen as you would expect, when you sort of had people -- a lot of people go back to work atonce, the pace will moderate. Same thing with economic activity. Most forecasts call for, youknow, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pacethat we had in the third quarter. So, in a sense, that would be -- that would be as expected. Wehave been concerned that the downside risks, though, are prevalent now, which are -- which arereally the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that households will runthrough the savings they've managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that couldweigh on activity. But what we see up to the present really is continued growth, continuedexpansion but at a gradually moderating pace.\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYhas generally exceeded expectations. And I do think it's likely that further support is likely to beneeded for monetary policy. And fiscal policy, I just mentioned the two risks that I think we face,and those would be well-addressed through more fiscal policy. One is the further spread of thevirus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people's balancesheets that will dwindle. But I -- you know, I think it's appropriate for us not to try to prescribefor Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of itshould be and leave it at that.\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYcan, which is to replace lost incomes for people who are out of work through no fault of theirown. And then what we can do is we can obviously support financial stability through ourlending programs, and we can support demand through interest rates and asset purchases and thatsort of thing. So we're going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors. So Ithink all of us lived through the experience of the -- of the years after the global financial crisis.And for a number of years, there in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight.And I think I just would say that I think we'll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at leastsome more fiscal support when it's appropriate, you know, when it's appropriate and the sizeCongress thinks it's appropriate. I do think that that will likely -- and, by the way, you see, youknow, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggestsgenerally that there will be something.\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYmajor markets. But after that period we've understood all along that our purchases are alsosupporting economic activity, and that's important. And that need hasn't dwindled at all. So wehaven't looked at reducing purchases. So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say thepurchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still. And, bythe way, they're sustaining the gains we've made in financial stability. You know, we don't -- wedon't take anything for granted. We don't expect that things will deteriorate. But, nonetheless, wehave a habit of keeping things in place for a while. So we're not taking our gains in financialare just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have. And, youknow, as you know, these, we're buying 120 billion a month. That's 1.44 trillion, if I remembermy times tables. And it's just providing a lot of support for economic activity and, by the way,removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did. So this is abig program, and it's doing a lot of good. And we also -- today, you know, we had a fulldiscussion of the options around quantitative ease -- not quantitative easing, the asset purchaseprogram and, you know, we understand the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it todeliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate.

My second question is you talk abouthow you follow the epidemiology. You're looking[ Skipping and audio breaking up].And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [skip] Christine Lagarde laying out whatthe ECB plans to do. As you lent an ear to what she had to say, the dire warnings that she wasmaking this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe's in, what can you and yourcolleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you've talked about and we've allfeared when it comes to a policy response?\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYin the United States. And it's certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been asgood as it's been so far. So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here. You know,stimulating aggregate demand is one thing. But where there's a part of the economy that kind ofwill be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy. And, of course, you need healthcare policytoo. I didn't see Madame Lagarde's comments this morning, but I took the sense of that questionto be the spread of the disease in Europe and what do we think about that? Yeah. So as Imentioned in my -- in my opening remarks, it's a concern. We have a widespread spike in casesacross the country, more in some regions than others. And even if we don't have -- and I don'texpect that we would -- sort of government imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, thatpeople who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel,going to restaurants, going to bars and things like that, that they may pull back in a situationwhere suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community. So I do thinkthat that's a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and the cases spike. That could weigh oneconomic activity. One would expect that it would. We thought the same thing, in fairness, aboutthe wave we had this summer in the South and the West. And the economy, you know, seemedto move right through that. This one seems to be larger and more widespread. In any case, it's arisk is what I would characterize it. I would characterize it as a risk as I did in my -- in mycomments.\n","2020-11-05 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  PRELIMINARYknow they're limited in what you can say or the degree to what you'd want to advise Congress,but a simple question: Do you feel that you're being heard?

I would not say that anybody's feeling comfortable about this, though. You know, we'vegotten through the first five, six months of the expansion better than expected, but we do see inEurope. You look at—look what's happening in Europe. Look what's happening here, anotherspike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more. So I think we have to behumble about where we are relative to this disease. It hasn't gone away. Clearly, you know,therapeutics are advancing. Research on vaccines are advancing. Death rates are way down.Hospitalization rates are lower now. But—so we're learning. But, I mean, we are so—we're veryfar from saying that we think we've got this and eliminated the tail risks.

We're buying municipal securities of up to threeyears. So we're doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3) you know,which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearlylaid out in the law. So we're actually doing that now. But I see that—what that is from ourstandpoint is a rare thing that we do under Section 13(3) when regular intermediation in thecapital markets or in the banking system has broken down. It's no longer working. So we step inunder 13(3) and we provide liquidity. What turns out to happen is we announce a program, andthe market starts working. So we only actually have to do a backstop. The amount of financingthat's happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year. Andwe didn't do it. We did—we've done a very small number of loans. But just the fact that we'rethere as a backstop seems to—seems to get the private parties to get back together and get thething where we're just another federal financing agency that's available to direct credit to—youknow, to very worthy borrowers. That would be more along the lines of a GSE. That's not whatwe do.

Do you see continuing strong pressure for the\rdollar to go up in the face of that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. No, one of the reasons we repaid our debt so\rquickly was that there is the risk of a snapback. As I say, the only\rthing that is supporting us at the moment is really the interest rate\rdifferential. Market expectations toward the dollar are still very\rbearish.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH.

In any event, if there is a\rstrong movement, one can't do very much. But if the dollar goes up,\rsay, three pfennigs in one day, wouldn't it be better to absorb some\rof that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. Well, the rise of the dollar has been almost\rtotally during the European hours, and the Bundesbank has been\rin one\rprepared to\roperation or the other. By the time we come in, the market is pretty\rlimp. We have been able to do small amounts. We haven't wanted to do\rtoo much for fear that the market psychology would turn against us\rsaying:\r\"Aha, the United States is trying to drive the dollar down\rSo it's a very, very delicate question. On the other hand,\ragain.\"\rthe Bundesbank has had some of the same problems with the mark that we\rhad back last fall when the dollar was going down and we were having\rtrouble stopping the slide, even though we were intervening in big\ramounts.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. The market moves against the intervention is\rwhat you are saying. The dollar goes up in Frankfurt against the\rBundesbank intervention and doesn't go up in New York despite the\rabsence of intervention.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. We have been prepared to operate a little, but\r[the dollar] has been pretty steady in New York.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We need to ratify the transactions since\rSecond?\rthe last meeting. Do we have a motion?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","SEVERAL.\r\rSecond.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\rrecommendation?\r\r[Approved]\r\rwithout objection.\r\rYou have a\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARDEE. For once I don't have to recommend any swap\rrenewals. But I do have a rather complicated transaction to describe,\rso that I can be authorized to complete it. When the dollar came into\rdemand in late February, early March, the Bundesbank supplemented its\rspot sales of dollars with forward sales of dollars against marks for\rdelivery in early May. The choice of dates was related to the\r\r\f3/18/80\r\rdomestic liquidity situation in Germany. Mark liquidity was expected\rto be more ample in early May than in early March, so the forward\rsales of the dollar would help mop up some of that excess liquidity.\rSince the Bundesbank\requivalent of marks.\rThe total was\rwas sharing half of the mark proceeds of its spot sales of dollars\rwith us at the time, and we had no idea how long the dollar would\rremain in demand, we asked them if they might also share the proceeds\rof the forward sales. It took them several days to come back with an\ranswer; and when they did, they set some conditions that required\rconsultations on our side within the Federal Reserve and with the\rIn the meantime the dollar continued to rise and the System\rTreasury.\rIn view of the\rcontinued to make good progress in repaying swap debt.\rTreasury's need for marks to cover the Carter notes, we finally\ragreed. In response, the Bundesbank raised no objection. But after\rfurther review on their part, they insisted that the Federal Reserve\ras the central bank of the United States be the direct counterparty on\rthe forward contracts rather than the U.S. Treasury.\rSubject to your approval, the solution we have worked out is\rone\rthat the System would enter into two sets of forward contracts:\rwith the Bundesbank to obtain the marks directly from it, so that as\rthe central bank of the United States we are sharing in that\roperation; and the other between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury\rto pass the marks directly on to the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\rThese transactions would be at the same rates, so there is neither\rprofit nor loss to the System. The reason I am laying this out to you\ris that the Bundesbank\r\rAs Manager, it is\rdifficult for me to argue that these transactions would be\rExceptions have to\rbe expressly authorized by the Committee. Consequently, I am\rrequesting authority from the Committee to make an explicit exception\rThe Treasury needs the\rto the rule so that we can complete the deal.\rSince some of the Treasury's mark debt is at\runder the Carter notes.\reven higher mark rates than those on these contracts, the cost\rcomparisons are not excessively unfavorable to the Treasury.\rMoreover, should the System need to incur additional swap debt before\rfrom us so that we could use the marks in repayment. The transactions\rare quite complicated but essentially mean that the U.S. authorities\rworth of marks to work with\rwill gain an additional\rshould the occasion arise.

So we\rcould have a surge in borrowing, which is not really a reserve\rbalancing decision but just a portfolio balancing decision on the part\rof those institutions, that we would need to adjust for in our\rnonborrowed [path].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is no question that if new borrowers\rcome in for emergency reasons or because they are new, we will have to\rmake an adjustment to allow for that.

I think it's a\rmajor hazard to introduce something that is going to be as difficult\ras this for the banks to handle on top of all this other stuff that we\rhave been giving them.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. My only point was that if the Board and the\rCommittee wanted to do away with lagged reserve accounting, the time\rto do away with it is when the whole new reserve system goes into\reffect, [when it is] applicable to other institutions.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rI understand that consideration.\r\rMr.\r\rRoos.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

STERNLIGHT.\rI would say that what we have in mind from\rday to day is more of a nonborrowed objective. Although as I\rdescribed, in certain circumstances, such as when we get a bulge of\rborrowing over the weekend that may have been caused by banks\ranticipating a discount rate action, it seems sensible to come in\rbelow, let's say, a nonborrowed interim objective.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

If we don't provide the reserves in\rnonborrowed form, they will have to get the reserves either through\rborrowings or be deficient in their reserves.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

ROOS.\r\rAre we fearful that interest rates will\r\r[rise]?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. The Committee has set bounds on the funds\rrate.\rIf total reserves were the overriding objective, bar nothing,\rthen we could drive interest rates up to just about any point, I would\rthink.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And even then we can't affect total\rreserves.\rThe banks are just going to borrow. What we can affect is\rhow much they borrow in any particular week.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH.

The important point really is the one you made a\rwhile ago, Chuck, about the need for reassessing the nonborrowed\rreserve target more frequently. I was on the call and I sensed that\rwe really ought to be doing that; we did speed it up last month, but I\rwould like to see even more.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Balles.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BALLES.\r[Unintelligible] keep the level of borrowed\rAnd to the surprise\rreserves at about what we would hope to have it.\rof most, if not all of us, the necessity of frequent adjustments just\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-11-\r\rdidn't come along for a long time. It looks as if perhaps February\rmight have been the month when it could have been used. The question,\ras you look back in a little post-mortem, Peter, is whether it would\rhave made any difference. Would it have helped the cause, so to\rspeak, in preventing total reserves from getting too big, if we had\rdone what we thought we would have to do on that October 6 game plan,\rwhich is to put the discount rate up?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, of course, the discount rate was moved\rin the middle of February along with the Desk taking measures to\rimpose greater reserve restraint. There was a certain amount of\rpressure that emerged almost automatically out of the process just by\rour sticking to our nonborrowed path when the banks were demanding\radditional reserves. That automatically imposed some increased need\rfor borrowing. And then a further downward adjustment was made in the\rnonborrowed path to increase the degree of pressure, and at about the\rsame time the discount rate was raised. So by forcing the banks to\rborrow--I think it was around $1.8 billion--at an even higher discount\rrate, we put still greater upward pressure [on rates].\rWhat we got,\ras I described, was a very substantial move in short-term rates of 3\ror 4 percentage points over a few weeks. And I think it got some\rbanks feeling that they were staring very hard at the possibility of a\rcrunch and the prospect of just not being able to fund themselves. So\rin that sense the program is working; it has [produced] very real\rrestraint for the banking system. I don't know that bigger moves or\rearlier moves in the discount rate would have done anything more than\rwas being done [through our operations].\rI don't know that we should\rhave [done] more because I think we were imposing quite a bit of\rrestraint.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BALLES. One other question, Mr. Chairman. I would like\rto ask Steve something in this case, in conjunction with the Bluebook\ralternatives. Steve, would it be reasonable or even feasible for the\rstaff to attempt to estimate a level of the discount rate that would\rbe consistent with the money growth targets?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, I share much of what Mr. Sternlight says.\rIf you want to estimate an interest rate that would produce these\rresults--I was hoping this method would get away from that a little-it seems to me that, if anything, it would be more like the federal\rfunds rate. In essence, if you look over a long enough time period,\rit doesn't matter very much what part of the total reserves is\rsupplied by nonborrowed reserves and what part is borrowed. What\rreally matters for determining the money supply is the amount of\rreserves, the total base out there to support money in some multiplier\rsense. And over a long enough period, it can't really matter whether\rthat's through nonborrowed reserves or borrowed reserves. In the very\rshort run because of this mix, with required reserves fixed, it does\rmatter because it affects the behavior of the funds rate given the\rdiscount rate. But if we put in a high discount rate, then for any\rgiven total reserves we would have less borrowed reserves and more\rnonborrowed. If our estimate of the discount rate is low, we'd have\rthe reverse situation. So, while we could do that, we would simply be\rchanging the mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves for any\rgiven level of total reserves that would support the money supply. I\rdon't think that would be very helpful to you; we would be glad to do\rit, of course. I think in February the alternatives before the\rCommittee were: making an adjustment in the funds rate fast by\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-12-\r\rraising the discount rate; making it more moderately by gradually\rlowering the nonborrowed path; or making it even more moderately by\rkeeping the nonborrowed path and letting a gentle rise in borrowing\rtake place instead of a rapid rise. What was actually done was to\rhave a small rise in the discount rate and a reduction in the\rnonborrowed path, which was somewhere in between all those\ralternatives.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BALLES. Well, if I could, I'd just raise one more point.\rIn asking my own staff to review what went on during that February\rperiod, it seemed pretty clear to us that the staff here and in New\rYork had done a fine job of guessing what the multiplier was going to\rbe, what the total reserves should be, and what the nonborrowed path\rshould be. There was very fine work on that. Yet the net outcome was\rthat total reserves got out of hand on the up side for a while. What\rI am trying to get to the bottom of, with the benefit of hindsight, is\rhow you and Peter now think that could be headed off in the future.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, our views are probably marginally\rdifferent. A difference is that I might allege that we could hit the\rtotal reserve path week to week. I don't think it's very important to\rdo it, but we could without lagged reserve accounting. But we'd have\rto have very large movements in the federal funds rate because we'd\rhave to force the banks, within the statement week, to adjust their\rdeposits to the total reserves we'd put out there. We'd have to force\rthem to do it. Without lagged reserve accounting that is possible.\rWith lagged reserve accounting, that could also occur. If we allow\renough pressure on the funds rate, they could make the adjustments in\rdeposits but we just won't see it in total reserves until two weeks\rlater. So within a very short-run period it would look as if we were\rmissing our total reserves; but actually we'd be getting adjustments\rin deposits that would be [evident] in required reserves two weeks\rlater and we'd really not be off very badly. We would just be over\rpath for a while and then we'd be back on path. That's the essence of\rwhat Mr. Sternlight is saying and I wouldn't quarrel with that\rparticular statement. Indeed, the money supply is coming back on\rtarget now, or seemingly so, if March turns out as we are projecting\rit. There has been a rapid response to the rise in the funds rate\rthat has occurred, just as happened in October, which may be a\rcoincidence or it may be that the lags [in response to changes in] the\rfunds rate are not six months [but are closer to] one day. It's hard\rto believe the latter but something like that has happened for two\rsuccessive periods. I am not sure whether I have answered the\rquestion, but I think I at least came close to it.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. MORRIS. May I ask Steve a question? The advocates of\rcontemporaneous reserve accounting argue that there would be less\rvolatility in the funds rate than under lagged accounting. Do you\rsubscribe to that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Oh no, I think there would be quite a bit more,\rfor one reason. The one [internal] reason is that Mr. Sternlight\rreally won't be \"able\"--and I put the word in quotes because I don't\rmean that he's really managing the funds rate--to adapt his operations\ras readily because in the current week he won't know required\rreserves. [Suppose] this week we're going to provide $100 in total\rreserves. Given the fluctuations in deposits that occur from week to\rweek, we really won't know whether the required reserves in the week\r\r\f-13-\r\r3/18/80\r\rIf they\rrelative to the $100 in total reserves would be $20 or $90.\rturn out to be $20, Mr. Sternlight is going to find that as he puts in\rnonborrowed reserves, there are going to be huge declines in borrowing\rand huge declines in the federal funds rate. And he's not going to\rhave any alternative but to chase those borrowings down and put in\rmore nonborrowed. Because of the volatility of deposits week to week,\rI think we'd be certain to get more fluctuations in the federal funds\rrate. However, with the system we're now operating on, where he knows\rrequired reserves and we make adjustments on an average path for a\rfour-week period, we make those adjustments so that we [take into\raccount] the required reserve pattern that we know for certain over\rthe two weeks ahead. And we tend to make the borrowings the same in\reach of those weeks.\rSo we let nonborrowed reserves vary with the\rdeposits while tending to hold the borrowing stable in an average path\rI know that sounds like gobbledygook, but it\rfor a four-week period.\ris what we do.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Wallich.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. I wonder if I may ask two questions? The first\rone is to Steve. Steve, on contemporaneous reserve accounting, how\rmuch of a change in deposits would you need in order to sweat out $1\rof reserve deficiency?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD.\rGovernor Wallich.\r\rI am not sure I get the gist of your question,\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rIt depends on what the multiplier is.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. The multiplier on demand deposits at the moment\ris roughly 6. So if we took put in $1 of reserves, we ought to get $6\rmore, roughly, in demand deposits. But that is not certain; if we put\rin reserves, they may end up in currency or anywhere else for that\rmatter. But that's the multiplier on demand deposits; it's a lot\rhigher on time deposits.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. The point I am trying to get at is:\rIsn't the\radditional adjustment you get from contemporaneous reserve accounting\rrelatively small? You need a very large movement in deposits in order\rto overcome a small deficiency or surplus of reserves.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Contemporaneous reserve accounting, as nearly\ras I can tell, does only two things for you. First, it absolutely can\rremove interest rates in some sense from your consideration. If you\rbelieved that there was a multiplier that the staff could predict, you\rcould set total reserves; you'd have to chase borrowing up and down\rbut you could come closer to hitting that total reserve target in a\rgiven week. Lord knows what interest rates you'd have, but you might\rhave the money supply. So the interest rates would be forced to\radjust to the reserves. We wouldn't be doing what we do now, which in\rsome sense is to make adjustments in nonborrowed reserves to\rdeliberately force more interest rate pressure on the system. The\rsystem would evolve its own interest rate pressure either up or down\rSo contemporaneous would do that for\ras we put in the total reserves.\ryou; it would remove some little element of prediction we still have\ras to what interest rates we want to see in order to achieve the money\rThat element is left in lagged reserve\rsupply [objectives].\raccounting. The other thing it does, of course, is to speed up the\r\r\f-14-\r\r3/18/80\r\rresponse by 2 weeks. The latter isn't all that important presumably\rbecause 2 weeks out of 52 weeks is not any big deal.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH.\r\rAnd you can anticipate it anyway but--\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. What it really does, in my mind, is to remove\rthe necessity of making judgments about where you want interest rates\rto be.

We will have to have an exhaustive\rdiscussion of these questions when we put contemporaneous reserve\raccounting squarely on the table, so perhaps we shouldn't waste too\rmuch time now. I don't think we are going to change [our procedures]\rat this meeting.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. May I ask my other question? Peter, what\rdetermines your decision to buy coupons? You mentioned that you\rbought nearly $1/2 billion.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, we were in the midst of a period of\rsizable reserve provision and it was a judgment that we should divide\rup that purchase. We anticipated the need to provide for an outright\rincrease in the portfolio of some $1-1/2 billion. It seemed\rappropriate to do the bulk of it in the bill area, but we had not\rbought any coupon issues for a few months and just in accord with the\rpast dispersion of our buying it seemed appropriate to do some portion\rof it in coupons.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

I would like to ask what may be the same\rquestion John Balles asked but in a little different way. Had we\rraised the discount rate early in March, having in mind that through\rthe period total reserves would be over [path] by about $700 million\rplus, would you not [conclude] that we'd have come closer to the total\rreserve path and that the adjustment would have been a bit quicker? I\rguess the alternate question is: What would you have projected for\rinterest rates? Would they have been any higher absent the\ranticipation [of a discount rate move] that was going on?\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-15-\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. If you had taken a further upward discount rate\raction from 13 percent, say, to 15 percent, I would have predicted a\rfaster adjustment of\r\rthe money supply only if that rise in the\r\rdiscount rate also meant that you were going to permit the federal\rfunds rate to rise substantially. If you weren't going to permit the\rfederal funds rate to rise substantially, I would assume that that\rupward adjustment in the discount rate would merely have meant that\rtotal reserves would be the same over time but with less borrowing and\rmore nonborrowed. But if you had permitted the funds rate to rise, I\rwould assume banks would have tightened loan terms and maybe sold off\rsome assets, resulting in lower bank credit, lower money growth, less\rrequired reserves and, therefore, less total reserves down the line\rseveral weeks later.\r\rdispatch.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\rMr. Eastburn.\r\rI hope we can proceed here with some\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Let me just say on these questions on\rdiscount rates--I didn't hear the last answer Mr. Axilrod gave--that I\ram not sure it makes a great deal of difference whether we move the\rdiscount rate or not, except for its signalling influence, which might\rhave been considerable. That's because we could adjust the\rborrowings, presumably, to achieve the same result. The reason the\rdiscount rate was not moved--let's be clear about it--is that we were\rwaiting for this program, and it seemed inappropriate to raise the\rdiscount rate when the Administration was trying to negotiate these\rpending changes. The judgment was either right or wrong; but it was a\rjudgment we made.

AXILROD.\r\rMr. Axilrod.\r\r[Statement--see Appendix.]\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In connection with that distinction--the\rwillingness or need of banks to borrow at the discount window--I think\rit is important that we all reiterate publicly or otherwise the fact\rthat this change in the discount rate procedures does not imply any\rgreater willingness on our part to tolerate borrowing. I think your\rdiscount officers ought to make that point to borrowing banks rather\rexplicitly. We don't know how they will react. One can argue it\reither way. But any tendency for them to think that the window is\ropen because the rate, at least the surcharge, is closer to the market\rrate, should be discouraged or we will get a perverse reaction from\rthis action. I think a little more than usual calling to borrowing\rbanks may be justified under the circumstances to point out to them\rrather directly that this is no invitation to borrow.\rLet me just say in connection with setting the stage here\rthat the Chase Manhattan Bank said it is raising its prime rate to 19\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-17-\r\rpercent today. At the same time it is instituting a small business\rbase rate which remains at 18-1/4 percent, effective immediately.\rThey used some language [in their announcement] indicating that they\rthink this is consistent with the philosophy of [the measures]\rannounced by the Federal Reserve. They said they have some special\r[concern] for small businesses and they're acting to ease the strains\rthat small companies face in borrowing money. The special rate\rapplies to companies with assets of $1-1/2 million or below and bank\rloans of $1/2 million or below. With total bank loans of $1/2\rmillion, that implies that a company is borrowing one-third of its\rtotal assets. The bank said the small business rate would apply to\rseveral thousand of its smaller customers.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

We can have a general go-around with\rcomments. But apart from the general business situation, any comments\rthat you have about how far this restraint has gone and how far it\rneeds to go and what the special problems are, as I said, would be\rvery welcome.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. SCHULTZ. May I ask Steve a couple of questions first?\rSteve, I'm a little confused about the relationship between M2 and the\rother aggregates [in the Bluebook alternatives].\rFirst of all let me\rask this question: Is the relationship between the new M2 and GNP\rpretty similar to the relationship between the old M2 and GNP that\rpeople often looked at? I'll get that answer first.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. My memory is that we have ended up with a\rsomewhat better relationship. I had better not answer; my memory is a\rlittle off on that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. SCHULTZ. For the second more important question, let's\rlook at alternative B. The implied rates of growth for February to\rrates for December to June, but the growth rate for M2 has only been\rlowered by 3/4 point from 7-3/4 to 7 percent. Now, given the new\ractions, with the likely impact on money market funds, are we to\r[understand] that you believe there will be strong growth in MMCs and\r2-1/2 year certificates? How do you get that strong-MR. AXILROD. It may turn out that we seriously\runderestimated the growth that would occur in money market funds over\rthe first two months of the year. So there was a much bigger\rexpansion in M2 than the Committee, in effect, wanted at that time.\rWe have assumed that growth in money market funds would drop from here\ron to a rate just slightly above what it was late last year. However,\rthat was without taking into account the latest 15 percent marginal\rreserve requirement on those funds. Taking that into account, we\rwould think that their growth would continue but at a much slower\r\r\f-18-\r\r3/18/80\r\rrate. Using a rule of thumb that Governor Partee introduced to the\rstaff many years ago--and it's been difficult to find a [better] one-I would say that something like 50 percent of that money would go into\rM2 type deposits and another 50 percent would go into large CDs and\rTreasury bills that are not in M2 but are either in M3 or liquid\rassets. I don't think that's too bad a view because roughly 50\rpercent of the liabilities of funds are due to institutions and\ranother 50 percent to individuals. So I would expect that, if\ranything, the 7 percent M2 figure you are referring to may be a shade\rstronger than might develop in light of the program. But I wouldn't\rexpect the difference to be large. That's as far as we've been able\rto go [in our analysis].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I understand these inter-relationships\rcorrectly, the December-to-June figure you show has a monthly base,\rbut if it were on a quarterly base the way the yearly target is, the\rimplied 4th quarter to 2nd quarter figure for M-1A in alternative B,\rfor instance, would be 5-1/4 percent.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

But [the difference] is very substantial, Peter,\rDave, New York's [estimate] is about twice what the-MR. EASTBURN.\r\rYes, there's a very big difference.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. STERNLIGHT. The overall difference is about 8 percentage\rpoints but my impression was that the tax refunds accounted for about\r3 or 4 percentage points of that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. EASTBURN. Steve, could you say anything about your\rfeeling of confidence in that?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD.\rI was hoping not to. I consider this as\rreasonable an estimate as a group of human beings working together\rmight come to. I didn't give you the specifics, but it assumes\rroughly a $1 billion increase in M1 in the week of the 19th, which is\rthe week we're in, another $2-1/2 billion in the week of the 26th, and\rthen very little increase thereafter. But that gives us a high April\rfigure because from February to the end of March M1 will have\rI\rincreased 12 percent, roughly, and that gets into the April figure.\rwouldn't doubt, given our GNP projections, that we're going to have a\rsecond-quarter rate of growth close to what we've estimated here on\raverage, something like 4-3/4 percent. Whether it's going to come\rwith a large April or a large May or a large June, or whether it will\rbe an even distribution among those months, I really can't be very\rcertain. It would be misleading to say that I feel extremely certain\rabout this; I don't. But I don't think it's unreasonable.\rIt would\rbe what a reasonable set of people would come to at this point.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's fair to say, in the light of\rhistory, that there is no feeling of certainty about any of these\rnumbers.\rIt's my understanding that a refund will feed\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS.\rIs that right?\rdirectly into the money supply.\r\r\f-20-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, there will be checks received by\rconsumers. The uncertainty is what people will do with them. Will\rthey deposit them directly in their savings and time accounts--in\rwhich case it will go into M2--or will they put them in their demand\raccounts? And if they put them in demand accounts, will they hold\rthem for one or two days? In that case it will have some effect on\rM1 but a very small one. That is the reasoning [underlying our\restimate].\rIf people put the funds into demand accounts, we wouldn't\rexpect them to stay there long. Why would people want to hold more\rdemand deposits? So, they would either transfer the funds to another\rasset, such as a money market fund or a T-bill or something, or start\rspending them. In that case, any little upward effect would begin\rcoming down in May and June and July. The only evidence we've really\rhad was on the tax rebate program where checks were sent out to people\ras a tax rebate; those very clearly had a discernable money supply\reffect. On these kinds of refunds, we don't have the experience that\rwould enable us to be very certain about [the effect].\rSo, we are\rwaiting for something to happen; we haven't seen it yet and we may not\rsee it this whole-MS. TEETERS. Well, suppose the refund is real and it occurs.\rIs that enough to knock us off of our money path growth?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Well, as we said last time and this time also,\rwe think the effect in the three months of March, April, and May might\rbe on the order of 1 to 3 percentage points [unintelligible] and then\runwinding to that extent in June and July and piddling out in August.\rThat's our estimate of what might happen. But we haven't deliberately\rput that in.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a big seasonal in April to take\rcare of this in a normal way?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Yes, but the refunds this year are estimated to\rbe about $12 billion above the average of the last two or three years.\rSo it's more than normal.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rWhat is the normal?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. They are estimating about $46 billion, I think,\rso $33 billion or so must be normal.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. I don't remember the exact number. I don't\rknow whether Darwin [Beck] has it. Well, this year we're estimating\rthe individual tax refunds to be somewhere on the order of $48\rbillion. In 1979, total refunds were $36 billion. Reading back, in\rrecent years they were, in billions of dollars, 36, 34, 31, and 29.\rSo you can see that it's a quantum jump this year on the order of $12\rbillion. In March of the previous four years the refunds were around\r$9-1/2 to $10 billion; this year they will be around $13.7 billion,\raccording to these estimates. So it's a jump of $4 billion in March\rand roughly $3 to $4 billion in April.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rWho would like to make some general\r\rcomments?\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLES. I would just like to respond to the one question\ryou raised about farm credit.\r\r\f-21-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rWell, respond more generally, too.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WILLES. We have recently done a survey of our country\rbanks and they tell us they are as tight as a drum, and the farmers\rtell us [the banks] are as tight as a drum. Yet we have very few of\rthe country banks trying to pass on those loans to the city banks,\rwhich are not tight as a drum. When we get behind that, [we find\rthat] they're passing them off like crazy to the PCAs and so on, but\rthey're reluctant to pass them off to their city correspondents simply\rbecause the price is so high. So it's not really a question of\ravailability in the normal sense, but a question of their\runwillingness at least to this point to try to pass those higher rates\ron to their farm customers who are used to substantially lower rates.\rNow, I don't like the implication of that, in terms of the direction\rwe seem to be going, which is to give preference to small businesses.\rBut I think that is the real issue in their mind. It's not that the\rmoney is not there; it's just that they're unwilling, so far at least,\rto contract for the higher price.\rThe only other comment I would make is that, like many\rothers, I was disappointed in the movement in the President's program\rfor fiscal 1980.\rThat puts a little extra burden on [monetary policy]\rfor this year. Therefore, to the extent that we do err, I think we're\rgoing to have to err on the tighter side rather than the easier side.\rIf the deficit in\rFor fiscal 1981, I favor the reverse of that.\rfiscal 1980 is around $35 to $40 billion and then in fact [the budget]\rreally does get balanced in fiscal 1981, that's a $35 to $40 billion\r[swing] in one year.

MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, our staff has about the same\reconomic forecast as the Board's staff. I have a gut feeling that if\rthe forecast is wrong, the result is likely to be a deeper recession.\rI am thinking primarily in terms of the financial strains that the\rsystem will be under. I think we've all been amazed at the\rwillingness of consumers and businessmen to take on loans at extremely\rhigh rates. And it seems to me the counterpart of this is that we may\rgo into a recession [with] an awful lot of strains that are likely to\rlead to a deeper recession. One sector in particular that is showing\rgreat strains even in a forward moving economy is the savings banks;\rthe situation in New England is getting critical. I was a little\rshocked yesterday to find out that they may be in a position to have\rordinary access to the discount window within as little as two weeks.\rIf that's the case, we have an awful lot of issues to resolve. As you\rknow, in the past we have not loaned to organizations that were\rclearly insolvent. The fact is that all the savings banks in New\rEngland probably are insolvent if their assets are valued at current\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rThat's true of many banks, too.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. MORRIS. It's true of banks, too, but it's much more the\rcase with the savings banks, particularly in New England where the\raverage yield on their portfolios is very much lower than on the West\rCoast. That's because (a) we've been a slow growing region; and (b)\rNew Englanders don't change their houses as frequently as people in\rCalifornia do. That has led to a very old and very low yielding\rportfolio. So, not only do they have liquidity problems but they have\rvery serious earnings problems. Most of the savings banks in New\rEngland will probably show a deficit in earnings this year. There are\rother complications. There is this new dual rate which was set up to\rdeal with large commercial banks. I think that is perfectly fine, in\rlight of the fact that that's where the growth of credit has been most\rpronounced. But some of the most seriously troubled savings banks in\rNew England have assets in excess of $500 million. And the question\ris: Do we want to charge them the premium rate? Another problem is\rthat most of the savings banks in New England are not insured by the\rFDIC. We have a state fund which amounts to about $250 million. What\rdo we do when that fund is approaching its limits? We're going to\rhave an awful lot of issues in this whole area of lending to thrift\rinstitutions coming down on us very soon that will need to be\raddressed.\r\r\f-23-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

And I know a few of them are very uncomfortable about\rmeeting those commitments.\rIn upstate New York some of the country\rbanks have been expressing a great deal of concern about the effect of\rthe current level of interest rates on local small businessmen. I\rthink local small businessmen are not unlike the farmers in the\rMidwest. There are stories that automobile dealers are just closing\rtheir businesses because they can't finance their inventories; rather\rthan go bankrupt, they retire. We have the impression that\rinventories are generally modest, although for some small retailers\rthey are pretty minimal.\rI have the impression that in New York City\rretail sales are pretty good, but that may not be the case outside of\rthe city. We've had some indications that in the first two months of\rthe year there have been price increases, particularly by the large\rgrocery chains.\rSome people explain that as the reason for all the\rcoupons we're getting in our Sunday newspapers.\rIn effect, it's\rgiving back the anticipatory price increase.\rWe also have in our area the same grave concerns that Frank\rhas in Massachusetts and New England generally. Our thrifts are in\rvery bad shape.\rThree of the ten largest mutual savings banks in New\rYork were in the red for 1979, and probably more will be in the red\rIt is disintermediation on the one side and terrible\rfor 1980.\rearnings on the other side. My own feeling is that if the consumer\rhadn't been running out of gas before last Friday, he certainly has\rhad his accelerator taken away from him as of Friday. On the other\rhand, though, we're hearing that some companies are accelerating the\rFor example, if an annual\rtiming of their annual wage increases.\rreview was to be in July or August, they're bringing it forward. So\rthe consumer may have a little extra money in his pocket. The Board\rstaff's projections of the outlook for the next 15 months seem pretty\rreasonable. In all the circumstances, my thought is that we should\rhang in there, which is probably what \"B\" does.\rThat would be my idea\rof hanging in there.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal, what wisdom do you bring us\rfrom Atlanta in your first presence here? Welcome.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, sir.\rIt's nice to be here at this\rinteresting time. Shifting to another part of the country, Mr.\r\r\f-24-\r\r3/18/80\r\rChairman, the Atlanta District shows a remarkable reversal in\rattitudes concerning the economic outlook, it seems to me. Just a\rmonth ago our directors and businessmen generally were virtually\rdiscounting any recession, even a mild one this year. But in a\rmonth's time that sentiment has changed remarkably, as I say. They\rnow almost uniformly see a recession developing and perhaps a deeper\rrecession developing later this year. That even comes from our South\rFlorida directors who had been reporting very, very bullish conditions\rright through last Friday. These sentiments, of course, were voiced\rbefore the President's program and the Federal Reserve program. It's\rinteresting to note that this change is attitudinal and not based on\rany real change in basic economic conditions. Conditions in the\rDistrict generally are about the same as they were, although, of\rcourse, we have had some softness in real estate sales and\rconstruction activity and a slowing in retail sales. That has been\rreflected, too, in a less rapid run-up in bank credit than in other\rparts of the country. But the perception of the future is that we're\rin for a very difficult time. Our business people and directors see\rautomobile dealers, farmers, small business people, and thrifts being\rhurt pretty badly and I think there is a real fear at this point of a\rcredit crunch coming along. While I don't have any data, and my staff\rhasn't given me any data about small banks, I have an intuitive\rfeeling that some of the small banks in the District are probably in\rmuch the same condition as savings and loans, although perhaps not to\rthe same degree. My personal feeling, after hearing all of this from\rpeople around the District, is that the pessimism is perhaps a little\roverdone. Recession, in my judgment, would not be all that bad if we\rare going to get prices under control.\rIn terms of policy, it seems to me that we've got to get the\rmonetary aggregates under control. February was perhaps a one-month\raberration, but there was a run-up in the aggregates. That, together\rwith negative market reaction to the President's program, is really\rgoing to fuel inflationary expectations. Indeed, as has been remarked\rhere, with energy costs increasing in the short term we could have an\rincrease in inflation. That is bound to cause consumers to lack\rconfidence in what has been done by the Administration, and we could\rhave an increase in inflationary expectations with the obvious\rresults. So my judgment, Mr. Chairman, which is a little different\rfrom the staff's at the Atlanta Bank, is to err on the side of greater\rrestraint. While alternative B seems to me a viable alternative,\rwhereas I would not consider alternative A to be viable, my preference\rwould be to go for something along the lines of alternative C to\rdemonstrate in the near term to the markets that we're going to\rcontinue with this program of restraint.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Black.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are in general agreement with\rIf we were to shade it a little, we'd\rwhat the staff has [projected].\rshade it along the lines that Frank Morris described because of the\runrest we see in financial markets, along with weaker housing and also\rprobably weakness in investment, all of which we think may be more\rthan the staff is estimating. I would add one other caveat and that\ris the feeling on our part that the international situation may be\rweaker than is generally being assumed. So we would shade the\rforecast toward a little deeper decline than the staff has indicated.\rBy the same token, we would expect perhaps a more rapid recovery. The\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-25-\r\rstaff is actually showing no growth in real GNP between the fourth\rquarter of '80 and the fourth quarter of '81, and we think [GNP\rgrowth] will probably be positive.\rOn the policy side, it seems to me that the best thing we\rcould do is to continue the policy we've been following. I think you\rsaid it all, and very well, yesterday before those bankers when you\rstressed that the backbone of our policy still remains our efforts to\rcontrol the aggregates. Not everyone heard you yesterday; there may\rbe some general doubt that we'll do that and some expectation that\rwe'll back away. So, one could make a case for going with alternative\rC. But it seems to me that alternative B is strong enough to\runderscore our determination. The rates of growth in the aggregates\rfor the last part of that six-month period are substantially below\rwhat we actually had in the first three months, or think we had in the\rfirst three months. They are below our targets, so \"B\" seems to us to\rbe the best of the alternatives.\rSo far as the federal funds range is concerned, I would\rprefer to drop the top and also the bottom of that range. I think we\rare now to the point where we can do that. I would not want to raise\rthe lower end, a possible alternative suggested in the Bluebook, since\rI would like us to be in a position to let rates come down pretty\rfast, if they do tend to do that in the face of a controlled set of\rgrowth rates in the aggregates. I am sure that the Committee is not\rgoing to agree to abandoning that range; against that background,\r11-1/2 to 18 percent looks about right to us.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Winn.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, the crosscurrents are so extreme\rthat it's difficult to sort them out and get a fix, particularly with\rlast weekend's adjustments not being factored into many people's\rthinking. Three or four things, I think, are interesting. One is\rthat we turned off commercial construction--that is, apartment houses,\roffice buildings, and so forth--completely in October, and it turned\rback on in an unbelievable fashion in January and early February.\rWe've turned it off again, I think, really in the last couple of\rweeks; there are just no deals being made. But the profits picture\rthat is coming through on the deals that have been made are so unreal\rthat it's almost unbelievable. With the acceleration of rents and\rwith [builders'] fixed costs not moving up, the flows back to profits\rare very, very high. That's particularly true where tax relief\roccurred, in California and Texas and places like that. In spite of\rincreased operating expenses the profits picture is almost\runbelievable. So, if we get any stability in [interest rates], my\rguess is that those [activities] will explode on us again as building\rpicks up.\rThe second thing I'd report is that the major chemical\rcompanies are showing profits in the first months of the year, and\rI've seen figures for month-to-month developments. While these are\rworldwide operations and one can't sort it out [for individual\rcountries], it was interesting to me that the price increases from\rNow, I don't know how the price increases were divided up worldwide,\rbut these are pretty substantial price changes. They have those\r[changes] built right into June--this was before last Friday--so\r\r\f-26-\r\r3/18/80\r\rthere's a big move in some of these factors.\runbelievable.\r\rAnd their earnings are\r\rWhile building has phased down and the automobile industry is\rstaying a bit soft, [businesses] in our area are reporting\runbelievable orders and profits expectations. Our railroad people are\rreporting really quite good operating results, much better than they\rhad projected. And this is across the line, [even] with the downward\rpush occurring in their automobile business. Our banks are showing a\rmixed picture. Many of them are pretty well loaned up and are not\rseeing too much demand because of rates in agriculture and some other\rareas.\rOn the other hand, they are not seeing any problem with\rrespect to delinquencies or slow pays or any of the normal [signs] one\rsees on that score. We had, of course, in the last couple of weeks\rthis tremendous drive to increase commitments. Their customers were\rtold that lines of credit wouldn't be honored and they had to convert\rthose into revolving notes. So there was a tremendous scramble to\roffset the anticipated [government credit] control system by such\rthings as price increases and wage increases and also by an explosion,\rreally, in lines of credit. They were taking to their boards demands\rfor loans that were 5 to 6 times their normally weekly increase.\rWe really don't know what the outlook is because we don't\rknow how people will adjust; it's a crude guess that we're making. In\rview of your statement yesterday and other concerns, I am very\rconcerned about the [potential] April bulge, which could be much\rlarger than is shown here. And unless we react to that, our own\rcredibility is going to be questioned even though [we expect the bulge\rto unwind].\rWe can't say \"Oh well, it's going to go down in May and\rI have a feeling that we have to\rrespond to current developments. While the targets of \"B\" seem to me\rappropriate, in order to make those targets I'd like to raise that\rfunds rate range by 2 points, let's say, to 13-1/2 to 20 percent, to\rgive the Desk [the flexibility to respond], if necessary, if we get\rthis kind of bulge. I don't want to raise it just to raise it. But\runless we respond to the increase, which could be quite large in this\rperiod, we're going to have a real credibility problem.\rI am impressed with those who watch the Desk. They will tell\ryou exactly what the intervention points were; they don't see any\rchange in terms of our intervention points which [they say are\rapparent] to the market. People, in spite of all the changes, are\rreading [our operations] as if we were operating under the old\rguidelines. While their perceptions are wrong, they still are\rperceptions; and we're dealing with perceptions as people interpret\rwhat we're doing and how they will react.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

BALLES. At times like this, Mr. Chairman, regional\rdifferences do show up rather starkly. West of the Rockies there are\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-27-\r\rprecious few signs of any present or impending recession, particularly\rWith the obvious exception of\ras our directors view [the situation].\rhousing and autos, things seem to be moving along at a very rapid\rrate. There is continued strength in consumer spending; it's almost\rhard to believe. I believe much of that still reflects a \"buy it now\rbefore it gets more expensive\" approach. Labor demand in defenserelated industries and high technology industries such as electronics\rand aerospace is contributing to continued strength in employment in\rthe District. Loan demand remains strong at banks and, despite the\rrecent flooding in California, agriculture all around the West seems\rto be in pretty good shape. I think the difference between West of\rthe Rockies and what Mark was reporting probably stems from the\rpredominance of large branch systems around the West. I know that in\rCalifornia our three largest banks are among the three largest\ragricultural lenders anywhere in the country. And, of course, a good\rpart of that lending is to agri-business, but they take reasonably\rgood care of the smaller farmers as well--to the extent that we have\rsome of those around the West, and we do. Demand for lumber you'd\rthink would be falling out of bed because of housing, and yet exports\rto the Pacific Basin area have made up a good part of that. So, in\rshort, while this may not be applicable to the national scene, our\rdirectors just don't see any signs of recession in our part of the\rcountry nor do they believe one is ahead for the regional economy.\rWith regard to the national scene, it's obviously a different picture.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\rof the national scene.\r\rYour area covers a not insignificant part\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Well, with regard to the Bluebook\ralternatives, I can't really add much to what has already been said.\rAll things considered, I would agree with much of what Willis Winn\rmentioned: One more month like February and our credibility is going\rto be in bad shape. We recently had the first of the ABA/FRB\rseminars, which originally was supposed to cover the subject of\rregulation under that plan that you encouraged us to get into. We\rhad, I thought, a very good meeting. We had a number of people from\rthe Board as principal speakers, some of the division directors and\ralso Governor Wallich as a principal speaker on monetary policy. We\rgot quite a bit of flak as I remember, Henry. There was quite a bit\rof skepticism expressed in that audience about whether we were going\rto stick to our announced target of ongoing restraint because of what\rthose February numbers were showing--and they were aware of them by\rthen--on the money supply. Another month like that would really\rundermine our credibility a great deal, so I share Willis' view about\rdoing something about the April bulge if we can. And I think we\rprobably should. In general, however, I would go along with the specs\rin alternative B.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The agricultural\rsector has been reasonably well covered in the comments made by Mark\rWilles and Bob Mayo. Our banks supplying credit to the agricultural\rsector are very tight with respect to loan/deposit ratios. But\rcontrary to what Mark suggested, we have found that the country banks\rare facing up to their problem and raising their interest rates to\ragricultural borrowers. They have no outlet for the loans even at\rthese higher rates, however, because the correspondent banks are not\rprepared to pick them up, even at a discount, at the rates the credit\ris being extended. [Cattlemen] are withdrawing from filling the\rfeedlots again as they turn their present stock, which implies less\rmeat in the future I suppose. Secondly, as we go into the planting\rseason, a period of high agricultural [loan] demand, there is a bit of\ra safety valve, if you will. There is still a lot of grain in the\rhands of the producers, which can be sold at the lower prices now\rprevailing. That would suggest that there will be a considerable\r\r\f-29-\r\r3/18/80\r\rsqueeze on farm profits in the period ahead. But I don't think the\rrestraint program will have a great impact on the agricultural sector\rimmediately. The grain embargo probably will have as great an impact\rWhat I am really trying to say is that\ras the restraint program.\rthere are tough times ahead in the agricultural sector.\rTurning to policy, Dave Eastburn captured my concern very\rwell. In the Bluebook we are looking at a 4-month period instead of\rthe usual 2-month period or even a quarter. It seems to me that\rcredibility of the Federal Reserve System may be the more important\raspect, at least of near-term policy. The potential bulge in April is\rpart of the problem. I'd hate to go back to the [procedures used]\rprior to October 6 and focus on interest rates. But I think it's\rextremely important--for international and domestic reasons,\rinflationary anticipation, and other things--that we not permit [the\rfunds] rate to come down very far in the next month or two. As a\rI would be inclined to move\rresult, \"B\" looks very reasonable to me.\ra little closer to \"C\" because of the potential for interest rate\rmovements if indeed the demand for money begins to ease somewhat\rbecause of the lower projection of growth.

How that will roll into the [next] two months, I don't know.\rSo, \"B\" would be reasonable and I would be inclined to move a little\rtoward \"C\" if that were the sense of the Committee. I would also set\rthe federal funds range by raising the lower end and reestablishing\rthe 4 percent spread, thus coming out with a 14 to 18 percent range\rwith the anticipation that interest rates would remain in the upper\rhalf of that range for at least the next 60 days.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Roos.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. ROOS. Well, [Mr. Guffey and I] are both from Missouri,\rand my approach to [policy] will underscore the great diversity of\rthinking that occurs in the great state of Missouri, Mr. Chairman.\rVery briefly, the general condition of the economy as we see it is a\rfairly level one with the exception of the building and real estate\rareas and automobile sales and manufacturing, which are obviously\rquite weak. Just last week we had a group of savings and loan people\rin for lunch, and they reported very severe trouble, as your savings\rbank people are experiencing, Frank.

Mr. Chairman, I would only add on the agricultural\rside that I think some of the trauma accompanying the announcement of\rthe grain embargo has subsided. There is a much calmer approach to\rthe problem and a little more Federal government credibility than\r[earlier] in the farm community, although they are still somewhat\rskeptical. We are, of course, in a very poor position on autos and\rhousing throughout our District. But capital goods are still running\rquite strong. This is typical of what one might call \"this stage of\rI feel more comfortable than I did last month with the\rthe cycle.\"\rGreenbook [forecast], yet I would not be surprised if we got down to a\rminus 5 percent quarter [for GNP] before this forthcoming recession is\rover. I think we are getting closer, much closer, to the peaks that\rwe keep visualizing and postponing, and we could easily have a credit\rcrunch--though I don't know how best to define that--perhaps in the\rnext 4 to 6 weeks.\rHaving said that, I would be happy enough with \"B,\" but I\rwould tilt also a little toward \"C,\" agreeing with what Dave had to\rsay. On the federal funds range, though, I would just leave the\r[lower limit of] 11-1/2 percent. It has no real significance now and\rI wouldn't want to see us push that up at this point. It restricts\rour image of flexibility when it gets published. Instead, I would\rjust go to the 20 percent on the up side and be done with it,\rrecognizing that that would give us cover for an interim period,\rrather than have to go back frequently to jiggle it up another half or\rone percentage point. I don't see any objection to going to the 20\rpercent, given the rate structure we have today.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rMr. Rice.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, generally I go along with the\rstaff forecast. It seems to me that the new anti-inflationary program\rwill have the effect of making the coming recession deeper than it\rmight have been and might even bring it on sooner. If I have any\rskepticism at all [about the Greenbook forecast], it's in the area of\rthe timing of the recession. The economy appears to be continuing\rstrong, or relatively so. If I read the Redbook correctly, most of\rthe businessmen around the country report remarkable equanimity in the\rface of the economic situation; they just don't seem to be excessively\rconcerned about--or, in any case, feel confident that they can deal\rwith--whatever is down the road. It's pretty difficult to find\revidence of weakness in the economy aside from housing and autos; one\rhas to look pretty hard. One has to look behind the industrial\rproduction figures to see that there would have been a decline in\rindustrial production had production of autos and parts not risen.\rAlso one has to note that capacity utilization in the primary\rprocessing industries and materials-producing industries has declined.\rAnd, of course, the average workweek has declined somewhat. These are\rabout the only signs I see of any emerging weakness.\rSo, I feel that our posture at the present time is about\rright, with the appropriate tautness in financial markets. I don't\rthink alternatives B and C leave us much to choose between. Actually,\r[for M1] the difference between them amounts to about $900 million at\rthe end of June, and that doesn't strike me as being very much money\rout of the total money supply. So, it doesn't really matter too much\r\r\f-31-\r\r3/18/80\r\rto me whether we choose alternative B or C. If we choose alternative\rB, it appears that we will have a slightly larger volume of money\rstarting in April and a less substantial rate of increase in the third\rand fourth quarters. On the other hand, if we choose alternative C,\rwe will have a lower rate of increase in the second quarter and a\rhigher rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters. Given the\rcurrent situation, it would seem to me better on balance to lean\rharder in the second quarter and increase the restraint then; that\rwill [show through] in the third quarter and allow for a slightly\rhigher rate of increase in those quarters when we expect the recession\rto hit. Alternative C would probably be more consistent with that\rscenario than alternative B, but I have to repeat that really it\rdoesn't make a great deal of difference. On the funds rate, for now I\rwould favor a ceiling of about 18 percent, but I am prepared to raise\rthe ceiling if market conditions [warrant].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Wallich.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. WALLICH. It's very difficult to tell what effects our\rpolicies are having. These high interest rates may hit some borrowers\rvery hard but they don't seem to hit others at all, and the net effect\rone can't predict. I see that Charlie Schultz, after the President's\rprogram was announced, predicted a 2-1/2 percent rise in GNP for 1981,\rso he doesn't seem to think that this has a very powerful impact. I\ram particularly concerned about the inflation forecast. I view the\rforecasts of both our staff and the Administration as wildly\roptimistic. The very slight recession that we are anticipating is\rvery unlikely to make that kind of dent in the inflation rate. Of\rcourse, we have a history of always underestimating the rate of\rinflation.\rI am aware of the repercussions of a firm policy at savings\rbanks, small commercial banks, and elsewhere. As these [problems]\rcome toward us, we have to be prepared to meet them, and I think we\rshould meet them in a liberal way--stretch our powers as far as they\rcan reasonably be stretched. But we should not be obsessed by the\rconcern that the recession may last a little longer or even be a\rlittle deeper. As I look back over our record, I am impressed that we\rnever stopped fighting recession. We moved imperceptibly from\rfighting the last recession and its consequences into worrying about\rthe next recession. And that recession concern essentially has\rdominated our thinking and has brought us now to 15 percent inflation.\rIt's a situation with very poor options, but I lean toward the firmer\rThe market has not been impressed\rones. That is, I lean toward \"C.\"\rby our policy package except abroad. The bond market hasn't responded\rvery much. Short-term rates are actually down. I think there is a\rreal danger that if we now give the impression that we are about to\rrelax our general credit restraint behind a shield of selective credit\rcontrols, we will get the worst of both worlds. We'll get the\rselective controls not working--I have not been very enthusiastic\rabout them anyway--but we should do what we can not to disavow them\rcompletely. That is best done by not throwing any burden on them and\rby holding to a firm general control. I think it's important at this\rtime not to convey the impression that the regular discount rate,\rwhich wasn't changed, is the discount rate and that essentially we\rhave taken evasive action in trying to avoid raising the discount\rrate. We should so operate on nonborrowed reserves that there is a\r\r\f-32-\r\r3/18/80\r\rgood amount of borrowing at the surcharge so that the rate acquires\rsome credibility.\rIf we\rFinally, I share the concern about the April bulge.\rhave taken 15 percent out through the seasonal adjustment, there must\rbe a lot of money out there--in reality, people don't draw checks on\rseasonally adjusted checking accounts--and that may have its effect.\rSo in addition to \"C\" generally, I would like to see a funds range of\r14 to 20 percent.

Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that our posture\r[If it was]\rof restraint had begun to bite before this past weekend.\rbiting before this past weekend, presumably it will bite a little more\rnow. I have to admit I've held such views on several earlier\roccasions, so I don't know how much weight to put on my current view.\rWe did hear reports last week, however, of several real estate\rdevelopers being cut off by large banks in our District. Our recent\rsurvey of the agricultural credit situation does not reveal the\rtightness that has been reported elsewhere in the country. And I do\rhave the impression that our farmers are among those who are carrying\rexcessive inventories at the present time, largely in the interest of\rdeferring income tax liabilities.\rI don't know to what extent the Greenbook projections assume\rthat the capacity of people to adjust to an inflationary environment\rIn my area\ris behind us or to what extent it might still be ahead us.\rSome\rI see indications of a good deal of capacity to adjust further.\rof this, of course, flows from the firm linkage that seems to have\rdeveloped between that area and foreign sources of funds for\rinvestment. Just to indicate the extreme to which this seems to be\rI am told that at the present time builders in our major\rgoing:\rcenters who complete expensive houses which they don't sell promptly\rto local purchasers sell them to foreign buyers who then furnish them\rand rent them out. And this is a means of investing funds at\robviously very low rates of return currently for the purpose of\rgetting into real estate, in this instance in fairly modest-size\rpackages. There are a lot of small business firms being sold to\rforeigners as well, all the way from the family-size motel to the\rfamily-size manufacturing firm. That seems to be going on yet at a\rI note that the oil drillers have been in Washington\rrapid pace.\rrecently; they have about as much reason for being here at the present\rtime as the farmers had a year ago and two years ago. The number of\ractive rigs is at a 23-year high; the increase during the past month\rwas almost spectacular and the increase over the past year was also\rvery strong.\rSo, the signals are mixed. As I say, it seems that credit is\rbiting but activity is still very strong and the outlook is strong. I\rthink there's also a good deal of capacity yet on the part of\rindividuals to adjust the management of their financial situation to\rcontinued expectations of inflation. Possibly one indication of this\ris the alacrity with which they are willing to give up accumulated\rinterest on CDs for the purpose of turning them in and getting a new\rone which will carry a higher yield. This has resulted in actual\rlines of people at banks in some recent weeks when the new rate\rannounced was significantly higher than the rates on outstanding CDs.\r\r\f-33-\r\r3/18/80\r\rAs to monetary policy, the \"C\" proposal seems preferable\rtoday, primarily for the reasons that Steve Axilrod outlined in his\roral remarks. Others have commented along that line. That's all I\rhave to say.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Teeters.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am in favor of alternative \"B.\"\rEven [with \"B\"] the rate of growth [for M-1A] in the period from April\rto June would be dropping to almost half of what it was in the first\rtwo months of the year; even compared with the first three months,\rit's very low. If we go to alternative \"C,\" we're going to be cutting\rgrowth relative to the first three months in half, and that implies to\rme a very stringent credit market. If people think they've had\rstringency these [past several] months, it's only going to get worse\rif we go to the more stringent specifications. I will be very brief:\rI support alternative \"B\" as it now stands with the 11-1/2 to 18\rpercent range on the federal funds rate.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rGovernor Partee.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't know what's going to happen to the\reconomy. Perhaps I am associating with people who are in difficult\rsituations and have become very pessimistic, and it may be affecting\rme. So, I may be more pessimistic than I ought to be. I would point\rout that the projection seems to me very, very sensitive to the saving\rrate. The projection shows no increase in the saving rate in the\rsecond quarter and, therefore, the second quarter continues to be not\ra bad quarter. If in fact the saving rate should increase in the\rsecond quarter, it would be a bad quarter for the economy. And that\rcould happen. On the other hand, the projection has sizable increases\rin the saving rate in the third and fourth quarters, and those are the\rquarters of major recessionary movement. Whether those increases\roccur or don't occur will affect the character of that pattern. So,\rwe still have the uncertainty that has been with us for some time, and\rthat is: What is motivating people and how might [their behavior] be\rchanging?\rI do feel that everything that has happened in the last month\rhas increased liquidity preference. The rise in rates, which was very\rsharp and very noticeable, and the cutting off of credit cards to\rcertain low income groups, even before the President's program, have\rbeen played up in a major way in the local press here in Washington.\rThe feeling that one might need to rely on one's resources more and on\rother people's resources less in the period ahead leads to an increase\rin liquidity preference, which would tend to give us rather larger\rmoney numbers, generally speaking, relative to GNP than was the case\rbefore. I also think that the relationship between M1, or narrow cash\rbalances, and the real economy is changing adversely. That is, it\rtakes more and more M1 in order to get a particular real income; or we\rget less and less real outcome for the same M1 we had before because\rof [higher] cash balances, to the extent that people are buying more\rwith cash and not using gasoline credit cards and so forth. The\rcredit lines that have been extended, many of which may call for\rcompensating balances, and the fact that we are forecasting more and\rmore inflation, mean either that a given M1 is going to carry with it\ra higher interest rate or lower real activity, or both. And I think\rboth is probably the case.\r\r\f-34-\r\r3/18/80\r\rSo it seems to me that it's just the wrong time to be\rdeparting from the notion of a rather normative, reasonable increase\rin the monetary aggregates. I would very much resist moving to a\rlower aggregate path like alternative C. If we get the recession,\rEmmett, which I believe we will, I think we'll find that the demand\rfor money in the second half of the year will be low enough so that\rour problem won't be so much the upper end of our range but keeping\rgrowth within the lower end of our range.\rThat brings me to one more point, which is that I would hate\rto have somebody ask me what I was doing during the crash and have to\rremark that I was defending our credibility. The people who say let's\rkeep those interest rates up there, regardless of what happens, are\rreally walking into a major trap for the economy and for the Federal\rReserve. I very much want to disassociate myself from that. I would\rgo with alternative B. I would adjust that path and slice a little\roff April and put it into May. I think that has the same effect, if\rthere is a bulge in April, as going with alternative C. I am\rsympathetic to the idea that we need more room in the funds rate range\rbecause there is a very good chance of a big bulge, and the Manager\rought to be able to move if there is a bulge. If there is no bulge, I\rwouldn't expect him to move. Therefore, I rather like the idea of a\r14 to 20 percent range on the funds rate which, with the rate now at\rabout 16-1/2 to 17 percent, means we have some room on both the up\rside and the down side.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

Let me make a few observations that\rFirst of all, it's clear\roccurred to me in listening to all this.\rthat the economy is fairly level, so any month we look at these\rfigures we're going to find some things down and some things up. What\rthat means for the future isn't very clear. There's considerable\rstrength and resiliency over broad areas of the economy or it wouldn't\rbe holding level or a bit on the up side in the face of a decline in\rhousing and a decline in autos and some other industries. What stands\rout to me is that we haven't any room to grow here, given the declines\rin productivity and other pressures on the economy. And if we tried\rto stimulate growth very much, we really would have no chance of\rdealing with the inflationary psychology; we'd in fact face a blow-off\ron the inflation side if we don't already have a blow-off.\rSecondly, in my opinion--and everybody can be his own\rpsychologist--at this point we don't have many believers in the view\rthat inflation is about to ease off or, indeed, that the economy is\rabout to fall out of bed. There is more nervousness than there used\rto be and some people are beginning to question whether they shouldn't\rIt was characterized for me in talking to some\rchange their views.\rfarmers from Iowa the other day, and I think their attitudes are\rprobably similar to [those held by people in] other sectors of the\reconomy. A couple of them sitting near me said that they had bought\rsome land last year at prices they considered exorbitant but they\rbought it confidently with the thought that prices would be even more\rexorbitant this year. And they are wondering whether they made a good\rbuy. In fact, they're beginning to wonder whether they could sell it\ror should sell it, but they haven't seen any evidence of a decline in\rland prices up until now. They were getting worried but they hadn't\rseen anything. I suspect that a lot of industrialists are thinking\rthe same thing in their own way. The fiscal policy program--and I\rthink it has been underestimated a bit in the public press for a\rvariety of reasons, political and otherwise--I certainly don't think\rwas strong enough to change these attitudes in any significant way.\rIt may be to the contrary in the feeling that if anything is going to\rbe done, it's going to be done through the credit policy side.\rSo far as the outlook is concerned, it seems murky to me. I\rhear all these fears of recession and I even share them. But if you\rask me analytically whether they are any more certain now than they\rwere a year ago when we began hearing the same things, I don't know.\rI am pretty well convinced that it's going to start some time and that\r\r\f3/18/80\r\r-36-\r\rthere's a risk, when it starts, that it may be greater than anybody is\rprojecting. But I thought that a year ago, too. Just when it will\rreally start, who knows? I know we--all of us, I think--have\rmisjudged the timing again and again. I share the thoughts that some\rpeople have expressed, most recently Governor Schultz, that we better\rget this over with in terms of minimizing the total pain over a period\rof time. I am worried about those financial institutions, and the\rworst thing that can happen to them is [for us to] fail to do the job\rand get the interest rate turn fairly soon. But the way to get the\rinterest rate turned is not by hastening it prematurely. If we have\ranother false start, we'll be in considerable trouble even though that\rclearly runs the risk of overkill. That risk is greater in its\rinverse logic than if it's not killed at all; we'll be faced with the\rsame dilemma later on.\rIn that connection, in getting out of our dilemma as best we\rcan, I put considerable emphasis on one aspect of the voluntary\rprogram, which is to get banks to begin saying \"no\" on some loans and\rnot to put all the pressure on raising the prime rate. If the loan\rdemands come home to roost [and they take the latter approach], it\rwill exert pressures throughout the money market as they go out and\rtry to finance the loan increase. If we accomplish nothing else in\rthe next few weeks--and I think the time is very short--if we can get\rthat message to the banks and they can get the message to their\rcustomers, we have some chance of at least moderating the short-run\rinterest rate pressures. I don't think we have a chance of\rdissipating them but we do of moderating them and getting some element\rof rationing in the area of the market where it does not now exist,\rnamely among the bigger business borrowers. I would urge you to move\rpromptly on that voluntary program and get the questionnaires out and\rto begin on occasion, or maybe more than on occasion, a consultative\rprocess with the banks, particularly the biggest banks in your area\rvery promptly.\rWe have the April problem that has been referred to, and all\rof these things incline me toward resolving doubts in the direction of\rgreater tightness in the very short run rather than the opposite. The\rworst thing we could do is to indicate some backing off at this point\rwhen we have an announced anti-inflation program. We have political\rsupport and understanding for what we have been doing. People don't\rexpect it to be too easy. There is an understanding that a lot of\rburden has been placed on credit policy, and there's a willingness to\rbe supportive for the moment in that connection. I would not give all\rthat much weight to the degree of support we're going to get if this\ris dragged out indefinitely and we have to go through this process\ronce again.\rWhere that leaves me in terms of \"B\" and \"C\"--I don't think\ranybody mentioned \"A\"--is that at this particular juncture I find the\rfocus a little long, frankly, for me to come to any great conviction\rI share much of Governor Rice's feelings about\rbetween \"B\" and \"C.\"\rthose alternatives. I do attach some significance to the fact that if\rwe took \"B\" literally, while the numbers as presented on page 6 of the\rBluebook look low, [they imply] running above our annual targets in\rthe way we calculate those targets. If we were going to be at the\rmidpoint of the annual target, it would require a considerable decline\rin the second half of the year from the 5-1/4 percent quarterly growth\r\r\f-37-\r\r3/18/80\r\rpattern implied by \"B;\" and even \"C\" is above the midpoint of the\rannual target for M-1A. You are shaking your head \"no.\"\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS.\rthe rest of the year.\r\r\"C\" would mean 4-1/4 percent per quarter for\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. \"C\" is 5 percent for the first two\rquarters, as I have calculated it, and the midpoint [of our annual\rtarget] is 4-3/4 percent. It comes close to the midpoint but is a\rlittle above.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rYes, because February is behind us.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, there's no question that we have\rrecorded a high number for February, which has contributed to that\rBut again, I [wouldn't] worry too\rBut we have recorded it.\rresult.\rmuch about where this comes out within a range of 1/4 or 1/2 or even\r3/4 percentage point on a February-to-June number, since all of those\rdifferences are within our normal range of error anyway. That doesn't\rexcite me terribly at this point. Other people may have different\rshadings but whether we're looking at \"B\" or \"C\" or something in\rbetween in the four-month time perspective, I believe it catches the\rspirit of what a number of people are saying anyway, to say that in\rthe next month or so--certainly before we next meet--we should be\rleaning toward taking our chances on being certain to be near those\rI am not saying we can\rnumbers in that very short-run period.\rguarantee that we will be within those ranges at any expense of\rinterest rates or anything else. But when we're making up the paths\rand deciding what the level of borrowing should be or whatever, we\rought to be resolving doubts and making sure March is as low as\rprojected and April is no greater than projected or that both of them\rare lower than projected because that's where our principal\rvulnerability lies--in this two-month period. If April is anywhere\rnear as strong as the New York figures suggest, we'll be above the \"B\"\ralternative. I feel quite certain that we at least ought to be\rleaning in the other direction, and reasonably hard, during these next\rsix weeks or so. We don't want to give the market a false signal if\rthe money supply comes in very low for a couple of weeks that we are\rrelaxing too quickly during this immediate time frame, when we've just\rannounced these new programs and there is the kind of feeling in the\rcountry that I think exists. There is plenty of time before June to\rtake account of any shortfalls we might have in the money supply if\rthat happy event should occur in the very immediate future. I don't\rknow what the March data are going to show. If March came in under\rMr. Axilrod's projections and we were facing--in terms of our seat-ofthe-pants judgment or the pit of our stomach or whatever--the kind of\rbulge that is projected for April, we ought to be delighted with a low\rSo, I am suggesting that we lean in that direction.\rAnd whether we come out between \"B\" and \"C\" over a four-month\rperspective concerns me less than [that we take] this posture I have\rsuggested before the next meeting. We could reconcile my longer-term\rconcerns by making it someplace between \"B\" and \"C\" but in the end I\rcould probably tolerate either. But I do feel rather strongly about\rnot giving any false signals in the very short run at the risk of any\roverkill that might be implied by that.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. Would you consider taking a shorter period of\rtime--in other words, setting a target for March through May?\r\r\f-38-\r\r3/18/80\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I could, but it's probably going to take a\rlot of arithmetic here. As I say, we're going to be meeting again in\ra month and we can fine-tune the quarter further then. So that really\rconcerns me less than an understanding about what our posture should\rbe in the next month and how we will reconcile all the doubts and\rerrors and fluctuations in figures that we're going to have during\rthat time period. Whether it's expressed as aiming at \"C\" or being\rextremely resistant to anything above \"B\" doesn't concern me so much\rI would put money\rbecause I don't think those differences are great.\rin the bank if that happy day arose at the end of March or early April\rand the bulge that is being projected did not appear in that extreme\rform.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

I know borrowings are running over $3 billion on an average\rbasis, but you were talking about a $2-1/2 billion figure as-MR. AXILROD. We have suggested a borrowing assumption of\r$2-1/2 billion on \"B\" and about $2-3/4 billion under \"C.\"\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what the right number is, but\rassuming you judged those two correctly, I would be inclined to use\rthe higher number.

I think we're in a perverse situation here. If\rthose commitments are ever drawn upon, the banks are going to be\rpanicky and they're going to be putting their rates way up to protect\rthemselves.\rSo you can have something concrete to shoot at--and let me\rjust say again that the least of my concerns is precisely whether it's\r\"B\" or \"C\" over a full four-month period--and to capture slightly the\rFor M-1A,\rflavor of what I am saying, let me suggest the following:\ruse 2-3/4 percent for the February-to-June number; put the funds range\rat 14 to 20 percent, say, which again is no goal to shoot at obviously\rin either direction, but I'm trying to pick up the flavor of what has\rbeen said around the table; and aim at $2.7 or $2-3/4 billion or\rsomething like that in borrowings in the very short run.

I find it very difficult to conceive that\rwe're going to get to the lower end of the range before the next\rmeeting anyway. This is probably the least important number we put\rdown. And from that [perspective], it doesn't bother me.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS. I agree with that, but the idea of keeping the\rrange wide in case we do get into a crisis situation appeals to me.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.

TEETERS.\r\rIt depends on what happens afterwards, Henry.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we're talking about the visuals of\rwhat is announced a month from now and I can't convince myself that\rthis is an absolutely crucial decision. One could argue that raising\r\r\f-41-\r\r3/18/80\r\rthe funds range is consistent and reinforces the notion that we're not\rbacking off. On the other hand, if we don't change it, it can be\rinterpreted as an indefinite widening of the range.\rWell, we have a small mechanical problem. It is small in one\rsense; I don't know that it affects anything. The staff has written\rthe directive tentatively to include a growth range for the whole\rfirst half of the year, which makes it even less sensitive to what\rI don't know whether\rwe're talking about in the next month or two.\rthat's a good way to word it or not. The only problem with wording it\rfor the second quarter--and we can all convert this into a secondquarter growth rate--is that we don't know exactly what the [firstquarter] base is at this point. The equivalent of what I suggested,\rwhich is 2-3/4 percent for 4 months, would be about 4-3/8 percent for\rthe first half. And that begins to look a little too fine. We could\rsay 4-1/4 percent. The last published target we had was 4-1/2 percent\rfor the first quarter, which I take it we will exceed.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. PARTEE.\r\rMake it 4-1/2 percent for the half-year then.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can put in 4-1/2 percent for the halfIt doesn't capture the flavor that I\ryear, which is right on \"B.\"\rthought [we might want to convey] of putting it a little below that.\rBut in very round numbers, it's not very different. When we get down\rto the point of how to express it within a 1/4 of a point, it's\rdifficult. The 4-1/2 percent certainly implies no change. It implies\ra lower growth rate in the second quarter than in the first, given\rIt's a little easier than I suggested,\rwhat we know at the moment.\rbut I suppose we could take care of that by some language which says\rthat at least for the moment--I am talking about the period to the\rnext meeting--we want to be sure not to exceed [that growth rate].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. I think in October or sometime the language-not the number--was something like \"4-1/2 percent or a little less.\"\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, maybe we can use that language.\rI\rthink it captures what I am trying to say, maybe better than I said\rit. Well, let me review the bidding here.

And in terms of the projections given to us, we will\rlean to being within those projections for the March-April period in\rsetting the nonborrowed path target, interpreted as $2-3/4 billion of\rborrowings right now.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

What I am trying to get is some flavor.\rWe have to make a decision as to where to put [the initial borrowing\rassumption].\rI'd be perfectly happy to put it higher and resolve the\rdoubt that way in the first round. In any event [the staff] needs to\rknow what we're aiming for.\rI am saying that for the March-April\rfigure together we'd be unhappy if [money growth] were not at that\rrate and we'd rather tolerate a shortfall. Having said that, there's\rno promise we're going to confine [money growth] to that rate.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MS. TEETERS.\r\rThen you can't really confine the borrowing.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't mean to confine it.\rAll I\ram looking for is some assumption to go on. If you want to forget\rabout that, we'll solve it otherwise on the understanding that we're\raiming for 4-1/2 percent or a little less [M-1A growth] for the first\rhalf of the year.

And if that gets translated into the March-April\rnumber as projected, we'd be happy to come in lower than higher.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, just to be clear:\rAt the moment\rwe're projecting 4.6 percent [as the average M-1A growth for March and\r\r\f-43-\r\r3/18/80\r\rof this discussion, I would propose that we tend to even it out [over\rThat is, we'd target on something like\rthe four-month period ahead].\r3 percent or a little higher in March-April which would mean May-June\rwould be around 3 percent or thereabouts; the two periods would be\rroughly even. March would be low and April high, but pressed down\rrelative to what we show now, depending on what the data we get\rtomorrow look like.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I resist a little the precision that's\rimplied that we can make it 2 percent less than an uncertain\rprojection that-MR. AXILROD. Oh, no;\ron, not what we'd achieve.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.\r\rI was talking about what we'd target\r\rWell, that's one way of putting it.\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. SCHULTZ.\rIf you did it that way, that would show real\rresistance to that April bulge, if it occurs.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. Yes. We would be targeting on [a smaller]\rbulge. If it started coming in even as high as we have projected,\rwe'd begin resisting.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we should kid ourselves,\reither. If the New York projections turned out to be right and there\rwere enormous upward pressure [in April], I don't think we're saying\rwe would raise the federal funds rate to 25 percent in order to get\r[money growth] down to the plus 6 percent [upper limit of our longterm range for M-1A].\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

And there would be some language in the discussion\rto reflect--though I'd hardly put it in these terms--that we want to\rtake particular care not to exceed that rate in the period immediately\rahead.

TEETERS.\r\rHow much lower?\r\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we can take care of that in\rthe discussion. I was just trying to avoid some wording that relied\rupon an internal projection.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR. AXILROD. I understand.

Well, I think we'd have to wait until we look\rat the numbers and Mr. Sternlight and I have a chance to chew it over.\rBut one thought would be simply to make March-April 3 percent and MayJune 3 percent in round terms and even it out. We generally tend to\ruse an even [pattern] if we can. It doesn't seem likely that growth\rin March and April will be even, but maybe for the two months it\rwouldn't be unreasonable to target it that way. Then if March turned\rnegative at minus 1 percent, say, April could be plus 7 percent. That\rOr if March turned out to be plus 2 percent,\rwould be an example.\rthen the April [path] would drop down to a plus 4 percent rate or\rIt may not be that even; it will depend on what\rsomething like that.\rit looks like.\r\n","\n","[SECTION]\n","\n","MR.

PRELL.I have no quarrel with anything you said, Mr.Chairman.Indeed, it's a point that I have made many times, and Ihave convinced myself that I should be very leery about presentingthese kinds of simulations.If I don't buy the model in the baselineforecast, why should I buy the differentials literally? Now they areprobably the best we can do systematically at this point because it'svery hard to juggle all of these variables in a judgmental fashion andcome up with a whole array of alternative simulations. And we aretrying to improve the model so we can have greater confidence. Ithink the key question the Committee has to ask is whether it believesthe baseline. For example, those who feel that the NAIRU is muchlower or that the true unemployment rate is lower relative to theNAIRU would have a different baseline path so that the moststimulative policy wouldn't necessarily yield higher inflation than weforecast. It might be comparable to what we forecast. Still, thepoint, I think, is that you only get a short-run benefit, and not along-run benefit, if you feel that over time higher inflation has anegative implication for economic efficiency and productivity in theeconomy. That, I think, is the key judgment you folks have to make.\f-42-7/5-6/94\n","1994-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. LINDSEY.\n","1994-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

PRELL.I think it's a reasonably balanced forecast,given my suspicion that inventory investment in the second quarter mayhave been overstated. But I wouldn't want to make too big a point ofthat. The May figures held up very well; they were raised in the\f8/16/94-4-revised figures. To date, there hasn't been any evidence there. Butwe have, in essence, carried through a slightly higher level of theinventory/sales ratio, that having been achieved in the secondquarter. We do not have a significant movement; the ratio begins totrail off very slightly in the latter part of 1995.In a sense, atthat point we are beginning to get a little improvement in final salesand we begin to see the hint of a restoration of what we think is thesecular downward trend in the overall ratio. We have anticipated inthis forecast that the adjustment in stock levels relative to salestrends is going to occur in the distribution sector, particularlyretailing. We have allowed in effect for a substantial degree ofmanufacturing inventory accumulation, which is the area where we mighthave anticipated the upside risk to have existed because of thetightening in supplies and some of the pressures on prices ofmaterials and so on. Certainly, no inventory forecast is without itsrisks, but I think in this case the balance is not distinctly on oneside or the other.

YELLEN.I agree with the central message of theGreenbook that most of the new information that has accumulated duringthe last six weeks points to continued strength in aggregate demand.\f9/27/94-30-The incoming data do not yet provide any significant evidence of asufficient slowdown in real GDP growth. However, this is not based ona great deal of evidence. A lot more data will be coming in over thenext month that will clarify whether this impression is correct ornot.I personally am concerned that we have put quite a bit ofrestraint into the pipeline, a good share of it quite recently, and itadditional 100 basis point rise in the funds rate, I am considerablymore pessimistic than the Greenbook about the 1996 forecast for realgrowth. For example, in the MPS model the impact of such a tighteningbecomes really discernible only after about four quarters, namely byearly 1996. And after eight quarters, such a rise would take about0.9 percent off real GDP. That leaves me with a sense that a forecastof 2.2 or 2.3 percent real growth in 1996 may be overly optimisticwith that added restraint.A key question now concerns the behavior of prices--whetherthere is evidence at this stage that inflation is accelerating. Thisin my view is an especially important issue given our concern withinflation as an ultimate policy goal and also the feeling that theeconomy is operating at close to potential where there is a decidedrisk that inflation could begin to creep up. But here my analysisdiffers somewhat from the staff forecast. In particular, I think weare seeing and will continue to see for a time an increase in therelative prices of raw materials and imported goods. These higherprices will feed through into the CPI for a period of time, causing atemporary increase in the rate of inflation but not a permanentincrease in the trend inflation rate, or worse yet, an acceleration ininflation.I think the increase in inflation will be temporary evenif there is only enough restraint to hold the unemployment rate at itspresent level, roughly the natural rate given staff estimates. And Ithink the markets have overreacted to the increase in producer pricesin August.Now, the Greenbook is also forecasting that consumer priceinflation will be up for the next three quarters and then will returnto roughly 3 percent by the end of 1995, and I agree with thatforecast. My difference with the Greenbook concerns whether or not aperiod of unemployment in excess of the natural rate is needed to getI think not, but the Greenbook thinks thatinflation back into line.it will require a period of unemployment in excess of the natural ratein the latter half of 1995 and 1996 to subdue inflation, and that'ssomething more than a quibble because it does govern one's view abouthow much additional restraint it is going to take to hold inflation atits present level.To elaborate just a bit, I think we are witnessing now aperfectly normal cyclical phenomenon, namely, the relative prices ofprimary commodities and raw materials tend naturally to increase withthe level of domestic and more importantly world economic activity.The prices of these materials have been increasing rapidly all year,but from initially depressed levels.I expect these prices to risefurther due to faster global growth, but then I expect them to stoprising once economic activity stabilizes. Similarly, we have had asignificant depreciation of the dollar, which is causing and willprobably continue to cause for a time a rise in the level of importprices.But the staff doesn't expect the dollar depreciation to\f-31-9/27/94continue and so we should expect import prices also to rise and thenstop rising.My conclusion is that these shocks should feed into fasterCPI inflation only for a time, and once the adjustment is complete,I expect this toinflation should revert toward its previous level.occur even if the CPI increase feeds partially through into wages,although the greater this feedback, the longer this temporary burst inI agree with Governor Kelley that there is ainflation will persist.danger that inflationary expectations can overreact. Historically, Ithink the evidence on the likely pass-through of temporary priceshocks into wages is quite inconclusive.The only caveat I want to add in this analysis is that I'massuming along with the Greenbook that the unemployment rate is notgoing to be allowed to fall below the natural rate--and that means notvery much lower than it currently is--for any significant period oftime. With respect to the question of whether or not we are below thenatural rate, I think wage behavior provides the best direct evidence.The fact that wages have been so well-behaved, with average hourlyearnings rising only 0.2 percent last month, for example, convinces methat we have not overshot the natural rate.\n","1994-09-27 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. BLINDER.it at tha.I think 1/2 percent is on track, and I'll leaveOn the forecast, largely for reasons having to do withinventories, which I brought up at the last FOMC meeting and certainlywith the staff, I would look for the third quarter to be weaker thanin the Greenbook. By pure arithmetic, some of that difference isgoing to show up in a stronger fourth quarter. So, this is not amajor disagreement. But, on balance, it leads me to a somewhat weakersecond half of 1994 than the Greenbook forecast. Conversely, I'dexpect a bit stronger first half of 1995 than the Greenbook. Notethat the projected further tightenings of monetary policy built intothe Greenbook forecast could not possibly be slowing down the economySo, whatever is in the staff forecast forin the first half of 1995.the first half of next year has to have been built in by the previoustightenings. I don't think we have tightened enough to slow theeconomy down to 1.8 percent in the first half of next year.Accordingly, I'd expect the first half of 1995 to be a bit strongerthan in the Greenbook. But over the next year there may not be muchdifference between the way I see things evolving and the way theNow, for the eight quartersGreenbook sees things evolving in total.in 1995 and 1996, the average growth rate in the Greenbook is about 2\f9/27/94-32-If wepercent.I don't find that to be a very satisfactory target.have not yet overshot capacity, and I don't believe we have althoughone can't dismiss that hypothesis completely, the economy does notneed to grow at 2 percent for two years in order to keep inflationfrom rising. If we have already overshot, then indeed we do needsomething like that.Regarding inflationary pressures, I think we should realize,in the United States right now. There are lots of stories coming outof the manufacturing core of the economy about tight markets, verystrong capacity utilization, strong order books, good sales, etc.They are all true. But they are very much concentrated in durablesmanufacturing, which in round numbers is 10 to 12 percent of valueadded in the U.S. economy. If you look at the demand side rather thanthe production side and look back at the last year, we have hadbuoyant growth over the year, which has scared a lot of people. Thefour quarters ending in the second quarter of 1994 had a growth rateof 4 percent.It's the only time that we have had a four-quarterperiod with growth as high as 4 percent in this entire businessrecovery. In previous business recoveries, one four-quarter period of4 percent would not have scared anybody and, indeed, would have leftthe FOMC thinking that things weren't looking that great.More important than the 4 percent, I want to call attentionto the fact that that growth was highly concentrated. I looked atthese numbers last night.I knew the qualitative story, but I wassurprised at the quantitative dimension. We all know where it wasconcentrated--in business fixed investment, consumer durables, andhousing. Those three sectors account for roughly 1/4 of GDP on thespending side.I'm not talking about value added weights because alot of that is imports, which is a point I'm coming to. Those threesectors of the GDP over the last four quarters registered an 11.3This means by the laws of arithmetic that thepercent rate of growth.rest of the economy, the other 75 percent, registered a 1.6 percentgrowth rate over that period.Those three sectors, of course, leavingaside housing for now, are where the price pressures are--eithercurrent or incipient.If you looked at the Greenbook forecast for thenext two quarters and took housing out of the fast-growing sector, theresult would be even more extreme. We don't expect housing to be partof the fast-growing sector going forward; the staff doesn't; none ofus do. But, leaving housing in the fast-growing sector, those threesectors in the Greenbook forecast are projected in the second half ofthis year to grow at a 6 percent rate and the rest of the economy at a1.8 percent rate.If I moved housing over the sectoral line, thatspread would be exaggerated because we are expecting a slowdown inhousing.Regarding the point that I was making about inflationarypressures, many people in popular discussions point to internationalcapacity as a safety valve on U.S. inflation. This is greatlyexaggerated because roughly 90 percent of what we consume or use isproduced at home. The place where it has the most validity, however,is exactly where the pressures are right now--in business fixedinvestment, where over 40 percent is imported, and consumer durableswhere I don't remember the fraction that is imported. Those areIt is in thisprecisely the sectors where we are seeing pressure.\f-33-9/27/94very limited part of the economy where the international safety valveis most important.Finally, I want to align myself fully with the comments JerryJordan made earlier. I have been worried for some time, and I ambecoming increasingly worried, about the disjuncture between the MainStreet view of inflation and the Wall Street view of inflation.INone of us is sure thisjust want to point out an implication:disjuncture is actually a fact; I suspect it is, as Jerry does, but itIf it is a fact, the implication is thatis hard to know for sure.real interest rates look a lot higher on Main Street than they do onWall Street, and we should be mindful of that. If that hypothesis iscorrect, that's likely to mean that there is more punch in what wehave already done than we realize. Thank you.\n","1994-09-27 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

MELZER.In the third quarter, nominal GDP was up 6.7percent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year rise in fiveyears. More recently, nominal retail sales rose at a 15.1 percentannual rate from July to November, the fastest four-month pace sincethe spring of 1987. There are few signs yet that our monetary policy\f12/20/94-21-actions have slowed the pace of spending. Since March, for example,business loan growth has accelerated to an 11.1 percent rate, afterNevertheless, in my view monetary policy has shiftedfalling in 1993.toward restraint. All monetary aggregates have shown relatively weakgrowth since spring.Inventory investment has been very strong thisyear. In my view rapid inventory accumulation has been desired and islikely to continue for a time. Despite rapid inventory accumulationso far this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio has remained near thelowest level since the early 1950s. According to a recent survey byour staff, attempts in the Eighth District to build inventory,especially of finished goods, have been unsuccessful simply because ofcontinuing strong sales growth. One major motor vehicle manufacturerin the Eighth District reported that it held larger stocks than itstwo domestic competitors simply because, in contrast to its rivals, itEvenhad the capacity to keep production closer to the pace of sales.so, this firm has had difficulty in keeping its strongest sellingmodels in stock. Such observations matched the concern with respectto the nation as a whole expressed in the National Association ofPurchasing Managers surveys in October and November.In November, employment gains exceeded the robust averagemonthly increases from January to October and were more than twice aslarge as the average monthly rise in the civilian labor force.EighthDistrict unemployment fell to 4.7 percent in October, its lowest levelsince August 1974. That's a level at which we have been hovering forsome time. On a comparably measured basis, the nation's unemploymentrate has fallen to its March 1989 level, which in turn was the lowestsince December 1973.Notwithstanding this evidence of strength on the real side,the positive reaction of the bond and other financial markets inrecent weeks is heartening. I hope this means that the markets nowbelieve that the long-term inflation rate will not accelerate from itscurrent level. Whether the nearly universal expectation thatinflation over the near term, or the long term for that matter, willbe 3 percent or more is acceptable is another question, as is whetherI am not at allwe act today in terms of any short-term actions.averse to strong cyclical real growth if the thrust of our policy isconsistent with long-run price stability and we have credibility.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).The flood gate was it?\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).A less-than-successful building project.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

BROADDUS.I would think so, and I think it is certainlya very high probability that we are going to have to do somethingmore. The question before us this morning is whether or not we needto do some of that tightening today or whether we can put it off alittle longer. I think it is a very close call. My own preference atthis meeting would be to move the funds rate up 1/4 percentage pointto 5-3/4 percent. I realize the 1/4 point funds rate moves earlier inthe year had adverse reactions, and at that time some argued thatthose moves were made under sensitive circumstances. However, thesituation is very different now. We only recently made a very strongmove, so I don't think that kind of reaction would be a problem atthis stage of the game.I think the main argument for a relativelymodest further move today is that it would reinforce and lock in thequite considerable credibility gains that the November tighteningappears to have produced, as I believe John LaWare suggested. I thinksome reinforcement at this stage would be desirable given the verystrong recent data on both employment and spending. At the same time,a 1/4 point move would be significantly more restrained than any ofour last three moves, and it would indicate that we recognize the needfor caution as we move closer to the cyclical peak. So, my preferencewould be for a 1/4 percent increase.I also would like to second TomMelzer's comments about the need to consider some sort of inflationtarget, something to nail down our longer-term goals and objectives atthe February meeting.\n","1994-12-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I thinkthat we have more tightening to go, but I'm willing to wait untilearly next year. As a general matter, I agree with Governor Kelley-if you are going to do it, earlier is better. But I think we havebeen given some breathing room with the favorable CPI numbers.Itwould be useful to let us get past the end of the year and the yearend marking-to-market. That allows the markets a chance to settleout. Ultimately, I think that more tightening is going to benecessary. With all of the market and monetary restructuring that hastaken place, it is probably going to take larger swings in interestrates to achieve monetary goals.It is very difficult to generalizefrom past experience when the pipeline is going to kick in fully. Iwould like to see us give serious consideration to the longer-terminflation targeting approach that a number of people have spokenabout; Tom Melzer started off the discussion of it today.

I favor a symmetric directivefor several reasons. Part of it is my normal antipathy to, ordiscomfort with, asymmetric directives. But more fundamentally onthis occasion, I have trouble imagining what evidence we will get inthe next several weeks that is really going to help us address what Iconsider to be one of the key questions: What is the economy going tobe like and what is the appropriate stance or policy actions that willinfluence things later in 1995 and into 1996? It just doesn't seemlikely to me that we are going to learn anything in the next severalweeks that is going to help us very much in addressing thosequestions. I may be wrong, but we can have a conference call ifsignificant new information does materialize. Beyond that, thesuggestion has been made, and I certainly agree with it, that thereare a number of fundamental longer-run policy issues that theCommittee should discuss and perhaps try to reach consensus on.

PRELL.I think we went through this last time, and Iwon't repeat the four-part harmony answer on the 1994 error. In asense, we were thrown off by some movements in the numbers in 1993that caused us to hesitate to follow the model religiously. Lookingback over the past year--as you noted and we noted in the Greenbook-the behavior of prices is not out of line with the model forecast overthe past couple of years on the assumption of a NAIRU in the 6 percentarea. The behavior of compensation, including the latest reading,might on balance be a bit more favorable--too high in 1993 relative tothe model and on the low side in 1994--and that perhaps raises somequestion, but it is still within the confidence interval. At thisare well in line with conventional short-run Phillips curve analyses.We run many different models and we get different answers, and I thinkthis is a reasonable ballpark estimate of what the history embodied inthese models would suggest is likely to happen in 1995 on theassumption that we get this kind of employment data.\n","1995-02-01 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I will tell you one smallelement of this, however--or give you my position. With respect tothe International Monetary Fund, we are in a somewhat similarposition, though on a slightly different scale, as we are relative tothe Congress. The International Monetary Fund got itself into thissituation essentially in December. They realized that they knew lessabout what was going on in Mexico than we did. We knew a great dealless than we wished we had known, even though we had devoted aconsiderable amount of resources to this on a daily basis for at leastthe last year. What the IMF does know is that Peter Fisher and hiscolleagues as well as people here at the Board have much bettercontacts and information about the day-to-day operations in Mexicothan the Fund has. That is for two reasons:First of all, the Fund,for better or worse, does not have a culture that is designed tofollow day-to-day developments in the individual economies of membernations. Secondly, on the other side, the Mexicans are worldchampions in terms of obfuscating about economic information whilesimultaneously providing a lot of other information. Transparency ofthe way economic policy is conducted in Mexico, including monetarypolicy, is a very serious problem, and it is one that relates to thecomment earlier about the functioning of financial markets as well ascomments--what Governor Lindsey was asking about yesterday--concerningthe balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico from top to bottom.\f1/31-2/1/95-140-To extend Chairman Greenspan's analogy a step further--maybeI am taking it a step back--once we have put the house fire out, wewant to build a more fire-proof house and we want to try to encouragethe resident of the house to stop smoking or at least to stop smokingin bed. I think we have an interest in getting it done, not that weare going to create a mistake-proof economic environment in Mexico anymore than we can create a mistake-proof economic environment in theUnited States. We can hope that with some effort and a considerableexpenditure of Federal Reserve resources--I mean human resources andbudgetary resources in one sense--to fix things so that at least wewill not have these problems coming back.Let me come back to another point on resources.I share, forall the reasons Governor Blinder has stated, the concerns about whatwe will monitor and how we will monitor because this will have, amongother things, resource implications for the Federal Reserve System. Iwant to know whether I am going to have to budget one man year orforty-two man years to get this job done right. We need to know atthe minimum what we are going to be asked to do, and see whether it isfeasible to do it both in terms of resources and, as Governor Lindseyand the Chairman have said, in terms of the intellectual feasibility.\n","1995-02-01 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

JORDAN.So you have nominal spending rising at a rate ofless than 5 percent for eight quarters and pretty much a flat patternthrough 1996.It's not much different from the last severalGreenbooks except that at least it's flat now whereas before itdropped this year and rose later.So, to decompose nominal spendinginto its parts, you have real output rising a little less than 2-1/2percent on average and prices also rising a little less than 2-1/2percent, using the deflator anyway, to give you that nominal spending.Yet, you have a structure of interest rates in which rates are 6percent and higher throughout the yield curve for the whole eightquarter period. I look at that and say I don't know whether it's agood forecast or a bad forecast.I certainly don't have a differentone to propose, but in the sense of a \"reasonableness\" check, should Iexpect nominal interest rates to be in the 6 to 7 percent range whilenominal spending is under 5 percent for a two-year period?Comment?\n","1995-03-28 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. PRELL.If you are asking whether the relationship ofnominal interest rates to nominal growth looks abnormal orunreasonable here, I would say that there is not a very strongregularity in the history of the relationship between nominal interestrates and nominal GDP growth.We have played around with someeconometric exercises to see whether there is any information to begained by looking at that spread as an index of restraint andprospective real economic activity.It is weak.It can contribute alittle to explaining the prospects.I don't feel uncomfortable withthis forecast.I think the fact that the nominal interest rate is alittle higher than nominal GDP growth is consistent with our sensethat this is putting some drag on economic activity, just as the factthat the real short-term rate, a bit above historical averages as weperceive it, could be interpreted as being consistent with some modestmonetary restraint on top of what we believe to be some moderatefiscal restraint.That is very hard to say.The real rate ofinterest could vary considerably over a cycle or even a little longer.\n","1995-03-28 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

We haveinterpreted monetary policy per se as probably modestly restrictive atthis point. That is, the real rate of interest is perhaps somewhatabove the natural rate. But, in the total financial picture, we alsorecognize that credit availability if anything has been improving; theterms and standards of bank loans have been moving in an easingdirection; and we also have had an impulse through the exchangethat is tending to be stimulative over this period.

We may have a moderately tight monetary policy, butthat is appropriate in view of the tremendous stimulus that took placein 1991 through 1993.The other comment I would make, and we heardsome commentary on this issue today, is that any reaction to fiscalpolicy restraint, certainly any reaction to the prospect of it, isvery dangerous.

PRELL.I should emphasize that, given our limitedability to predict these relationships, the calibration of this isclearly very uncertain. I think the point of Tom's presentation here,which is a schematic one in a sense, is simply that if there are largeanticipatory reactions in the bond market, then you do not need tomove the short rate as aggressively in order to give a greaterstimulus to private investment spending. It's a simple point, and wedon't want to suggest by the precision of these charts that we cancalibrate that very neatly. Again, it's a broad conceptual issue andone that, obviously, I would think you folks would want to contemplatein thinking about where funds rates might be over time.\n","1995-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. BROADDUS.President Broaddus.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I would like to takejust a couple of extra minutes tomorrow when we talk about the longerterm strategy of policy, so I'll try to make these economic commentsthis afternoon as brief as I can.As our Beigebook report indicated, our three latest monthlymail surveys of retail, service sector, and manufacturing activity allindicated somewhat slower growth in these key sectors in our region inthe tone of the anecdotal comments at our June board meeting, at whichwe invite not only the Richmond directors but also our Charlotte andBaltimore branch directors, somewhat more bullish and at least mildlyencouraging. On the whole, I would say they suggested that businessactivity in our District may be bottoming out and getting poised for abit of a revival going forward. Our regional anecdotal tidbit of themonth is that the recent closing of Pennsylvania Avenue is going tocost the D.C. Government about $3/4 million in parking meter fees.Idon't know what that implies for the fund rate, but that's a fact forwhatever it's worth.Regarding the national picture, as I think I have mentionedbefore, we use a VAR model in developing our Humphrey-Hawkinsprojections and this time our projections are very close to theGreenbook's except for inflation; we are on the high side there. Weare showing about 1/2 percentage point more CPI inflation in both 1995and 1996--to be specific, 3.5 percent for 1995, which I think is theupper limit of the estimates you received from the members, Mike, and3.3 percent for 1996.Even allowing for the rising inflation in ourforecast, I would say that both the Greenbook projections and ourprojections in a sense are pretty rosy, at least from here on out.They both say that real growth hit its low point and inflation hit itshigh point in the second quarter, and they both project rising outputand employment and generally declining inflation going forward.Frankly, this gives me a little pause since, as we all know, rosyIn general, along with my staff, Iscenarios often don't play out.still think the risks are pretty well balanced, but I have to confessIthat I am still worried about the downside risks on the real side.think the recent weakness in employment and income growth could feedback into spending. Moreover, a slowing economy is always morevulnerable to downside risks, and I think Bill McDonough's commentsabout the downside risks in the external sector are reasonably welltaken. Against that background, I very much hope that the Juneemployment report is a little brighter than the last two.One final comment I would make on the financial side--I thinkthe 15 basis point jump in the long bond rate in response to that newhomes sales report in May was remarkable. It was, to be sure, a verylarge jump. But this is a series that everybody knows is unusuallyvolatile and it usually does not get anything like that kind ofreaction in bond markets. I think that reaction indicates how supersensitive even the longest-term inflation expectations are to\f-19-7/5-6/95relatively small bits of information. That suggests to me that weneed to provide a firmer anchor for these longer-term expectations andI'd like to come back to that tomorrow if I may.\n","1995-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

I think part of it has to do with our not really knowingwhether the ranges are something we should be shooting for--whetherthey are long-term objectives, or whether they are in effect shortterm monitoring ranges to be explained. So, I support the notion ofhaving a more extended discussion of what our goals should be in termsof thinking about restructuring the Humphrey-Hawkins statute and thekinds of things we monitor. I don't think this is the time to do it,because I am not sure we know enough now about what range we shouldmonitor, whether it should be M2 or M3 or something else. At thispoint, I certainly agree with the notion that if we change the M2range now, we are going to draw more attention to it.But at somepoint I think we do need to address the kinds of issues that AlBroaddus has raised and decide whether or not we are going to supportlegislative changes that would get us off the horns of this dilemma.\n","1995-07-06 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

BROADDUS.I am very much where Tom Melzer is.If I werea voting member, I would support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman,although I must say with a considerable degree of nervousness. Thatkind of nervousness has been underscored by Tom Hoenig and someothers. There seems to be a feeling--calling it a consensus may betoo strong a characterization--that we can be fairly confident thatinflation has reached a cyclical peak. The probability of that iscertainly higher than I would have expected a while back, but I thinkwe need to keep a longer-term perspective here. It was less than ayear and an half ago that we ended an extended period of substantialmonetary ease. While the risk of further inflation in this cycle issmaller than it was, I don't think it is zero and we need to keep thatin mind. I think a cautious approach involving a quarter-pointreduction in the funds rate is the appropriate degree of easing now.As MikeI would oppose a half-point reduction. One other comment:Moskow and others have said, it is important in communicating thisaction to the public to make clear that it is done in the context of acontinuing longer-term commitment to price stability. I would verymuch like to see the words \"price stability\" in the announcement thatwe will make this afternoon if we take this action.

One stems from an inquirythat we had just this week from a bank in our District. My sense isthat knowledge of this is spreading like wildfire through the bankingindustry, and I think banks are looking to the Fed to take someposition on this; they are asking whether the practice is legal and soforth. I presume somebody is out there peddling the idea, or thesoftware that supports it, or whatever. So, one question would bewhat can be said about these arrangements and maybe this discussionshould be continued later at lunch if that is more appropriate. Myother question is whether we have the capability to publish data that,without violating any confidences in terms of individual institutiondata, would give the public a better handle on what is going on.Clearly, some people are misinterpreting the stance of monetary policybecause they don't have this information.\n","1995-09-26 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

BROADDUS.I am still thinking of it in terms of those1987 figures and that would be a much, much stronger performance thanI think anyone was expecting back last summer. Given that, I think akey question at this point is whether that much stronger quarterlygain will be followed by another stronger-than-anticipated performancein the current quarter. Not many people seem to expect that. Ofcourse, the staff revised its 2.6 percent growth projection for thecurrent quarter down to 1.9 percent in the current Greenbook. But theGreenbook also suggests that there is plenty of upside risk in thatprojection, even though that risk is not getting much attention thesedays, and Mike underlined that very eloquently in his comments thismorning. In particular, as Mike said, production-worker hours havebeen growing at a healthy pace lately. The staff is projecting hoursto be up at over a 2-1/2 percent annual rate this quarter. So, even avery small quarterly increase in productivity could on the old basisgive us a growth rate in the current quarter of 3 percent at an annualrate or even higher. We have the very real possibility, it seems tome, of two consecutive relatively strong quarters despite all thepessimistic economic commentary we read about. With the economyalready operating at least in the neighborhood of potential GDP, itseems to me that that should be a source of some concern.The bottom line is that there is considerable room forforecast error on either side of the staff's 1.9 percent projectionfor the current quarter. From a policymaking perspective, the picturehopefully should become considerably clearer once we have some of thedata for the month of December. We will be getting that informationnot too many days down the road.One final comment:It disturbs me a little that the staff isstill projecting an essentially flat 3 percent inflation rate throughthe forecast horizon ending in 1997.I am not questioning theprojection. I am just stating that I don't like it very much. Since3 percent is such a mild rate compared to our experience over the last15-20 years, I think a lot of people--not around this table--areprobably fairly comfortable with that scenario. But it's worth\f-16-12/19/95remembering, if I have calculated this right, that at a 3 percentannual inflation rate the price level doubles in something like 23-1/2or 24 years. Moreover, a reasonable confidence interval around a 3percent point forecast would certainly include at least a 3-1/2percent rate of inflation, maybe something more than that. That's notprice stability. I don't think we should be satisfied with it.Inthat regard, Mr. Chairman, we talked in July about the possibility ofadding a longer-term inflation objective to our monetary aggregateI wouldtargets to make our longer-term strategy more meaningful.hope that we might have an opportunity to resume or reopen thatdiscussion when we look at longer-term issues at the next meeting.\n","1995-12-19 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

You made reference to slight declines in longer-term interestrates; you used the 10-year rate in the chart. As I think about yourforecast for the next six months, I ask myself what is going to happenafter real GDP decelerates from an indicated growth rate of around 4percent in the second quarter to rates in your forecast of 2.3 and 1.9percent in the third and fourth quarters; the monthly average for theCPI is an increase of .2 percent for the remaining seven months of theyear; housing starts drop from the 1.46 - 1.47 million area; motorvehicle sales and production drop from a rate of over 15 million unitsto something below that; and job growth slows to increases of only100,000 a month in the final three months of the year.

I agree with Ed Boehne that itwould be useful to state our goal in terms of maximum sustainablegrowth and the notion of trying to achieve price stability. It seemsto me that while we can set 2 percent or maybe something else as aninflation goal, I am a little skeptical that any one measure ofinflation is the right one. At any point in time, I can imagine thatthere will be problems with a particular measure, as there are nowwith the CPI. Intuitively, I am attracted to the notion of the GDPdeflator, but I will admit that it too may have problems at times.There may be unusual circumstances affecting the various measures, soI am hesitant to pin down a particular number.

BOEHNE.President Boehne.The future usually bears some resemblance to thepast, but the future is almost always different from the past. Ithink we are in one of those situations now where we do not know howmuch different the future will be. I believe most of us feel as wetalk to people in our Districts that it may be more different, atleast for a while, than we have become accustomed to. That higherdegree of uncertainty ought to make us more cautious about takingsteps at this meeting, and I feel very comfortable about keepingpolicy the same.Looking ahead, clearly the case for tightening and theprobability that we will have to tighten in the coming months would befairly high under the old model. That may indeed turn out to be thecase. On the other hand, it may not turn out to be the case becausewe may be able to remain on an unchanged policy course longer than wenow anticipate under these conditions without accelerating inflation.So, while I am prepared to support an asymmetric directive, it doesnot automatically mean in my mind that we are setting ourselves up fora tightening. That may indeed be necessary, and I think we need to bewatchful. Should conditions arise where we have to tighten, I thinkwe ought to do so and we ought to be decisive about it. But I do notknow when that tightening will need to occur, whether it will be nextmonth, the month after, or six months down the line. For today, Iagree that we should make no change in policy, be very watchful, andkeep an open mind as to what we ought to do at the next and subsequentmeetings.\n","1996-07-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

The first has to do with what Iwould call the dual purposes here, which is concern about withdrawalfrom the world versus a domestic political consideration. As somemembers have emphasized in this discussion, there certainly will comea time in the future when we will wish to be in a position tointervene in foreign exchange markets. I am sure that will happen.We have managed to intervene in foreign exchange markets quite a bit.I can't think of any instance since I have been here when we reallyhad to intervene. It certainly was not because of an emergency or afinancial crisis. As I recall, every time we intervened the reasonreally came down to what was in effect a domestic politicalconsideration. Some major trading partner had too high a currency ortoo low a currency or something of that nature and that was the realmotivation. It was not a systemic risk situation. There was noquestion about systemic risk. In every instance that we can think of,except perhaps for some hypothetical developments in the future, weknow why intervention is being used. It has nothing to do withsystemic risk; it is an arm of the domestic political apparatus, and Ido not like that. I do not think that is what we are here for, and Ithink there are risks to this institution if we play that game.We really have to think about two issues. The first, as hasbeen mentioned, is the list of countries with which we want to conductthese transactions, and related to that is the question of whether ornot the other currency is a major store of value. Mr. Chairman, youindicated that we should exclude countries where the State Departmentdoes not want U.S. citizens to travel. I do not think we need arepurchase agreement with North Korea or Cuba, and I do not know whereelse we cannot travel, so I think that is too small a list of excludedcountries.\n","1996-07-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

BOEHNE.President Boehne.The economy in the Philadelphia District appearsto be on a modest uptrend that has tilted down from a somewhat fasterpace earlier in the year. Manufacturing is growing but at a somewhatslower pace. Delivery times, while lengthening in the spring, haveshortened more recently. Retail sales growth, quite healthy in thespring, has eased during the summer months. Nonresidentialconstruction is flat and the pickup in residential constructionappears to be decelerating. Employment growth is improving slightlyand some labor markets are tight while others still have slack. Priceand wage pressures on the whole still seem to be reasonably containedin the District.Turning to the nation, at the last meeting in early July wehoped that more information would help settle two questions--whethergrowth would moderate to a more sustainable pace and whether wageinflation indeed is beginning to accelerate. On the sustainablegrowth question, I think the bottom line is that the weight of thedata suggests a moderating growth trend but how much moderation is farfrom clear. On the wage question, the larger first-quarter gain wasrepeated in the second. Once again, however, sizable wage gains wereoffset by a small rise in benefit costs so that total compensation has\f-19-8/20/96been rising at essentially the same rate in 1996 as in 1995. On thewhole, price pressures remain remarkably subdued for this stage of anexpansion. Reasonable people can easily come to different conclusionsabout the outlook at this point. My hunch is that we may seeappreciable slowing in growth because of subdued personal consumption,more modest growth in business fixed investment, and some slackeningin residential construction. At the same time, upward wage pressureswill not likely bubble up into upward price pressures as much as onemight think because of continuing offsetting smaller benefit costs andstrong competition for products and services. Nonetheless, in thisenvironment I think we need to continue to monitor demand and pricepressures very closely.\n","1996-08-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

Now, it may be that the experience of the last 8 to 10quarters is a signal that the economy is changing. But we arestarting to see wage pressures and we are starting to see a flatteningout, if not an upturn, in most of the broad measures of inflation. Inthis environment, I do not think we can be quite as sanguine as manyhave suggested. I think we need to be very humble about our forecastsof the GDP slowdown being enough to guide this rather large andcumbersome plane totally on instruments without human intervention, atleast at this point in time. I think we need a course correction. Ithink we need to step in and start steering this economy a little bit.Now, it seems to me that if, in the expectation that the expansionwould be slower, we adjusted policy in 25 basis point increments, thenwe could start to steer it against an upside threat in smallincrements as well. It might be that the markets will overreact, butI think that overreaction would be short-lived. I do not necessarilybelieve that they would think we are all knowing because many of themhave seen the same trends that we see in some of the data. I amconscious of the fact that a lot of what we are getting from therather than how they think we should react. If some uptick in thethem back up to perhaps where they were earlier in the year, thatmight be helpful in restraining some of the possible sources ofovershooting that might be in the GDP forecast.So, I would agree with those who recommended a coursecorrection at this point. I could go with 25 basis points.\n","1996-08-20 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

In addition, I have a feeling that we are going to haveupward revisions in that area. We have had such revisions in the lastcouple of years because the survey does not take into account, as wellas it should, hiring by new businesses. There was a big upwardadjustment when the last revision was made, and I would expect to seeanother.

BROADDUS.I am not ready to do that.In a veryimportant sense, and this is really the main point I want to make, Ithink we still have some distance to go before we can be comfortablethat we have achieved price stability in the way we have defined it.The old Neal Resolution language, which we endorsed, defines pricestability as a condition where expectations of future inflation do notplay a significant role in economic decision-making. I think one ofthe best indicators of inflation expectations is the long-term bondrate. That rate averaged around 3-1/2 percent in the late 1950s andabout 4 percent in the early 1960s when the CPI inflation rate was ina range of 1/2 percent to 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate. Today thelong-term bond rate is at 6-1/2 percent, about the midpoint of itsrecent range between a little below 6 percent and a little over 7percent. There is not a lot of reason to think that the real longterm bond rate is much different now than it was in the earlier periodwhen it appeared to average around 3 percent. That seems to begenerally consistent with the surveys depicted in the Bluebook, whichsuggest that long-term inflation expectations are still on the orderof 3-1/2 percent today. Alternatively, if we compare nominal rates inthe earlier period with nominal rates today and attribute most of thedifference to inflation expectations between the two periods, theimplication would be that inflation expectations are anywhere from 21/2 to 3 percentage points higher today than they were in the late1950s and early 1960s. Beyond that, the volatility of bond rates is alot greater than it was in the earlier period and that volatilityalmost certainly reflects, at least to some extent, more volatileinflation expectations.So, Mr. Chairman, I would conclude that we are still somedistance from achieving price stability in the Neal Resolution sense,and I think we need to remain vigilant going forward.\n","1996-12-17 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. BOEHNE.I am reassured that President Broaddus isstanding firm in his commitment to price stability. I was gettingworried about that!The Philadelphia region continues on a modest growth trend,with most sectors reflecting this trend. Attitudes are positive andthe outlook is generally positive as well.Labor markets aregenerally snug, although places like the southern-most part of NewJersey and parts of Pennsylvania still have relatively highunemployment rates. Getting \"qualified workers\" is becoming anincreasingly familiar refrain among business people. It is somethingthat one hears almost regularly. Average wage increases, however,still remain in the 3 to 4 percent area, although I think theyprobably are concentrated more in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range.Almost everyone trying to sell something, from large businesses tostreet vendors, still reports stiff competition, which tempers thetendency to raise prices in this kind of environment.There is not much to be added on the national economy. Ithink the key points are that the economy appears to have successfullymade the adjustment downward from unsustainable growth rates earlier;it appears to be on a more sustainable track, and I think that is the\f-20-12/17/96outlook. On inflation, we are still operating in a cautionary zone.Performance is better, actually remarkably better, than one might haveexpected on the basis of historical experience. So, we are doingreasonably well there and are generally looking at a positive, evenenviable, position to be in. As has been pointed out, there areworries and potential problems, and we need to stay alert. But we canalso continue to be patient.\n","1996-12-17 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR. MEYER.The limited amount of data that we now haveavailable since the last meeting does not alter the picture of theeconomy, and that picture is a remarkably good one.Economic growthhas now slowed to trend. I read core measures of inflation as stableto still declining. The unemployment rate remains locked in a low butnarrow band. Still, I think we all appreciate that good monetarypolicy is forward-looking. So, the relevant question is, what changecan we look forward to with enough confidence to justify a change inpolicy today?Given that we are beginning from full employment, onejustification for a policy change would be a strong conviction thatgrowth over the forecast horizon will be persistently above or belowtrend. But the risks related to growth have really become morebalanced over the last several months.The Greenbook forecastindicates trend growth immediately ahead. The discussion around thetable suggests that few of us have a conviction that would justify avery different forecast. I compared the Greenbook forecast to five ofmy favorite private-sector forecasts, and the range is remarkablytight. On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, the range fornext year is from a low of 2.0 percent to a high of 2.4 percent. Thisis a very narrow range. Unemployment rates tend to be slightly higherthan in the staff forecast; they jump off from about 5.4 percent,which is the current rate, rather than the lower 5.2 percent rate inthe Greenbook, but again these forecasts are in a very narrow rangethat pretty much encompasses the estimates of trend growth.When we begin from trend growth, I think one thing that wemight also recognize is that slight differences in the forecast forGDP growth, differences that are much smaller than the margin offorecast error, produce qualitatively different forecasts. A forecastof slightly slower GDP growth at the lower limit of that range, like 2percent, produces rising unemployment rates, as in the consensus BlueChip forecast, whereas a slightly higher forecast of GDP growthproduces a degree of further tightness in the economy and furtherrisks of rising inflation that none of us views as acceptable.\f-28-12/17/96A second justification for policy change would be theconviction that we are already below NAIRU and not likely to move backto it quickly enough to prevent an uptick in inflation. This isbasically the staff forecast, and my view has been and continues to bethat this is the most serious risk factor in the outlook. Yet, we getstuck in place because we continue to be confronted by the reality ofstable to declining core inflation in the face of this prevailing lowunemployment rate. So, we wait for additional data to resolve ourdoubts. The risk of waiting, judging from the modest rise ininflation in the staff forecast, is not very great. Still, it isprobably worthwhile noting that in all of the five private-sectorforecasts that I looked at, there are increases in core inflation overThat is a pervasive tendency that just aboutthe next year or two.everybody is worried about.I think we need to keep that in mind.Just a little historical perspective: I think the majorthreat to an expansion comes from an ultimate overshooting of demandrelative to productive capacity and from the resulting acceleration ofinflation. I do not believe that business cycles are dead. Rather, Ithink there has been a coincidence of events that so far havepermitted us to avoid pervasive excess demand and rising pricepressures.I want to suggest a few of them that we have not discussedvery much. Demand is always chasing supply during the expansion, butI think supply has been more elusive than normal in this particularcycle.Effective labor supply has been increased by an apparentfalling NAIRU. In addition, we have had very strong capital spendingin this expansion, and as a result we have seen very rapid growth inindustrial capacity. So, if we look at the price pressures in theproduct markets, they seem even better contained than the priceI think that is an importantpressures in the labor markets.distinction. One reason why this absence of pricing leverage makessense is a lack of excess demand pressure in the product markets thatmakes firms more cautious about raising wages in response to laborincreases that do occur. Other factors that have inhibited the normalbuoyancy in demand at this stage in the cycle have been the continuingfiscal restraint and the persistent drag from net exports.So, supplyhas been increasing more rapidly perhaps than normal, demand has beenless buoyant, and that is what has created the current environment.But as I said, the business cycle is not dead; historysuggests that the risks are tilted in favor of demand ultimatelyovershooting productive capacity and causing higher inflation. Whilethis should not prevent us from enjoying the current balancedprosperity and good performance, it does suggest vigilance rather thancomplacency as we move into 1997.\n","1996-12-17 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MS.

But forbalance,who says that everybody already has as much money as theyneed so that the bank cannot find any more borrowers because there are too many lenders. Heconstantly argues that we should lower interest rates so the business firms will be more willing toborrow and produce more to catch up with demand; otherwise, we are going to have inflation.[Laughter] This leads me to be concerned about how directors are selected. [Laughter]A theme among other bankers around the District is that lending is being driven byasset assessments and not at all by cash flows or concerns about future cash flows. Bankerscomplain a lot that pension funds and insurance companies are doing deals that no sensible bankerwould be willing to consider. They indicate that income properties such as hotels, motels, stripmall outlets, all kinds of outlet stores, restaurants, and auto parts stores are having problems. Theturnover in such existing income properties is occurring at prices that these bankers see asquestionable. In Zanesville, Ohio, for instance, they reported that three of the five new auto partsstores that were built last year already were closed in the first quarter of this year. I guess thecapitalist system is working in a certain sense. Losses are being incurred.Another frequent complaint has been the Federal Farm Credit Banks. One bankersaid he lost 15 percent of his ag portfolio in the first quarter of this year alone to the Federal FarmCredit Banks. That caused another banker to say that they decided to get completely out of aglending because they could not compete on equal terms with the Federal Farm Credit Banks.One banker asserted that when he talks to customers about borrowing more, they areunwilling to consider the possibility of a rise in interest rates in the future. They believe that theeconomy is in a permanently low interest rate environment. To his frustration, when he tells them\f5/19/98that they have to allow for the possibility that interest rates could go up, they just dismiss thethought as being unrealistic because the economy has entered a new era. So, he argues that even avery small interest rate increase would have a significant sobering effect on acquisition prices thatare being paid. Another banker commented that all of his customers are bankrupt; they just will notknow it until interest rates go up.In manufacturing, directors have cited numerous examples of acquisition prices thatthey think are too high. For example,equipment business said that he is seeing acquisition prices worldwide that he thinks are out ofsight. In retailing, Dillard Department Stores bought Mercantile Stores on Monday of this week.When the CEO of Mercantile Stores, who is on my Cleveland board, called me over the weekend,he simply said that heapproved itfor his shareholders. That was the best he could say about the transaction.We heard more reports of sharp price increases in farmlands. One that I thoughtwould be of special interest to Don Kohn is that while we were in Wooster, Ohio, we heard thatover the course of the past year over 50 Amish families have sold raw land and moved to aneighboring county. They told us that farmlands that were going for $2,000 to $2,500 per acre ayear ago are now being sold for over $4,000 an acre.As an example of the tightness of labor markets, one banker said that whenever hesees a customer talking to a teller for more than a minute or two, it turns out that the teller is gettinga job offer. [Laughter]With respect to construction, one director said that this spring he has seen moreannouncements of new projects of every type than he has ever seen in the region before. Thisdirector is an official of a building and construction labor union. The surge in new projects may be\f5/19/98reflective of the mild winter and early spring. In any event he sees announcements of new projectsinvolving water, sewer, transportation and auto plants, hospitals, schools, road construction, andhotels all over the District. In Newark, Ohio, three new hotel projects have been announced bymajor chains, financed by institutional investors. So, we will have plenty of hotels in Newark.As others have noted, there are numerous reports of health care cost increases. Themost extreme that I have heard involves Pennsylvania Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which isrequesting a 30 percent increase this year.Turning to the national situation, over 25 years ago Leonid Brezhnev said that thefundamental problem we faced was that we can only distribute and consume what we actuallyproduce, and he felt that a capitalist plot was involved. But we do face that problem. How muchdemand is out there, what is fostering all of this demand, and what is the probability that we aregoing to have adequate aggregate supply to keep up with all of it? A year ago, I was hearingreports of good economic conditions, but also about the need to be cautious about taking risks.Now I only hear reports about good economic conditions. People's expectations about returns thatare available to them on a variety of investments clearly have risen very sharply, whether it is director indirect, in the equity markets, in residential and commercial income properties, and in varioustypes of new business ventures. So, in a relative sense, they view the costs of borrowing funds forinvesting as having gone down compared to what they can get on more secure long-term financialinstruments like Treasuries. I thought that Al Broaddus' initial analysis on this point was correct.We have all become accustomed to repeating the Chairman's way of phrasing theobjective of our policy and its success as being inflation that is so low that people do not even thinkabout it. In that sense, we have been meeting that criterion in terms of output prices. But acorollary also has to be that we do not see people making decisions based on the assumption that\f5/19/98asset prices will rise forever relative to output prices. In that sense, we are not meeting thecriterion, and we are not being successful. We all know that asset prices cannot rise foreverrelative to output prices or income streams. So, the good news is that this too will end. Thequestion is how and when. Over the last two years through the first four months of this year, I haveseen that not only is demand for output from households and businesses very strong, but it also iscontinuing to accelerate. I believe such demand is being fostered by excessive growth of moneyand bank credit and we see a lot of evidence that supports that argument. We need to see thatgrowth in demand slow down. It is not a question to me of no change or a small change in thestance of current monetary policy in terms of the interbank overnight rate. It is a question of asmall change now or a much bigger change later on.\n","1998-05-19 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  END OF MEETING\n","1998-05-19 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).

PRELL.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will start the presentation. We willbe referring to the package of charts entitled “Staff Presentation on the EconomicOutlook,” which may be at the bottom of the pile of papers in front of you. 2/Chart 1 provides a basic summary of the staff economic forecast. Asyou know, the BEA published its advance estimate of fourth-quarter GDPon Friday; it was a half point above our 5 percent guess. However, giventhat the BEA numbers do not really point us in a different direction--andthey are only tentative, in any event--we have stuck with the Greenbookfigures for our presentation today.The top panels of the chart show our projection for real GDP, on afour-quarter percent change basis. We are looking for a substantial2/ A copy of the material used by the staff is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 2)\f2/2-3/9921report--to around 2½ percent this year and next. As the bars in the leftpanel indicate, the slowing is entirely accounted for by domestic spending:The negative contribution from net exports is expected to diminishconsiderably over the forecast period.Though the growth of output is much slower, it is pretty close to ourestimate of the trend rate for potential, so that the unemployment rate--thered line in the middle panel--changes little from where it was last quarter.The chart also shows the movements in the factory utilization rate. Overthe past year, we observed the odd pattern of the plant utilization ratedropping somewhat below its long-term average even as the jobless ratewas reaching a 28-year low. We are anticipating that these indicators ofsupply pressures will continue to send conflicting messages, each of themchanging little on net over the next two years.As Dave will be discussing later, we have given greater weight to thelabor market tautness in arriving at the inflation forecast shown in thebottom panel. We foresee a noticeable pickup in the pace of price increaseover the next two years--about a percentage point as measured either bythe CPI or by the GDP chain index.Chart 2 presents some of the financial backdrop for this projection.The basic assumption is that the federal funds rate will be unchangedthrough next year. As you can see in the top panel, given our forecast ofrising inflation, this implies a further decline in the real funds rate-­proxied by the nominal rate minus the recent inflation rate. In fact, it isnot at all clear that inflation expectations have come down as far as actualinflation in the past year, so this measure may overstate the current levelof the real rate--and consequently may exaggerate the decline that liesahead. But I would characterize our forecast as incorporating a real shortterm interest rate that is at the low end of the range since 1995.The real short rate is scarcely an unambiguous or comprehensive gaugeof the financial impetus to demand, so it is worthwhile to look at a fewother indicators of credit market conditions. The picture is mixed. In themiddle left panel, you can see that nominal yields on Treasury andinvestment grade corporate bonds have fallen over the past couple ofyears--probably by more than longer-term inflation expectations. Junkbond yields also eased a bit until the market was jolted by the Russiandefault shock last summer. The junk rate index plotted here is now uproughly 1½ percentage points from a year ago, suggesting that the typicallow grade firm is facing a considerably increased long-term borrowingcost.The senior loan officer survey--the basis of the right panel--indicatesthat businesses also are facing a little less friendly reception at commercial\f2/2-3/9922banks, with loan underwriting standards having been tightened some inrecent months, especially in the case of larger firms.Credit has not dried up, however, as may be seen in the bottom panel,which plots the real debt growth of households and businesses combined.Through the fourth quarter, the end of the solid portion of the line, debtgrowth remained rapid. We are forecasting a moderation, but this isscarcely a credit-crunch scenario--as might have been feared for a whilelast fall. Lenders have turned a bit more cautious, but most of theexplanation for the projected slackening in debt expansion comes from thedemand side.If there are corresponding signs of increased caution in equity markets,they are rather difficult to find. Share prices have continued to soar, andwhere they are headed from here clearly is a crucial question for theeconomic outlook. The top panels of Chart 3 don’t answer that question,but they provide some provocative perspective by comparing theperformance of the U.S. stock market in the 1990s with a couple of otherimpressive bull markets of yesteryear--Japan in the 1980s and Wall Streetin the 1920s. Given the amount of artistry involved in choosing the baseperiods and thus aligning these curves, I would recommend taking thepictures with at least a grain of salt. But, if you have a taste for salt,perhaps they are suggestive of some of the risks confronting us.The middle panels come at the issue from an angle that is perhaps a bitmore analytical. At the left, I have repeated an exhibit I’ve used in priorpresentations to demonstrate why share prices had to peak soon. Perhapsyou should stop me before I do it again! [Laughter] The latestobservations are rough approximations, given yesterday’s prices and ourestimates of earnings through year-end. The S&P 500’s aggregate P/E isat an unprecedented level. And, to underscore the abnormality, it hasachieved this multiple not when earnings had a cyclical upturn in front ofthem but rather, as you can see in the bottom left panel, when the profitshare of GNP has risen to a multi-decade high. And, if the S&P multiple isremarkable, that for the NASDAQ composite--at the right--is astonishing,moving rapidly toward triple digits!Although some analysts would say--indeed, have said--that earningsare beside the point in valuing stocks in this New Era, we have not beenable to break the habit of looking at them--which may help to explain ourforecast errors. I have shown, in the bottom right panel, annual percentchanges in NIPA corporate profits--the black line--along with those forS&P 500 earnings per share. The accounting concepts and coverage of thetwo series differ, but they have tended to move together. In that light, thedivergence between our forecast of NIPA profits in 1999 and the S&Ppredictions of Wall Street strategists is worth noting. It suggests that the\f2/2-3/9923months ahead. If we had an adequate sample of the Wall Streetexpectations for 2000, I suspect that the story would be reinforced. Suchdisappointments have not stopped the market to date, but we haveassumed that--from such high valuations--it will be difficult to extend theuptrend in prices.If we prove to be anywhere close to right about the trend from here, thecouple of years. Chart 4 summarizes some of the key considerations inour forecast for domestic demand. Because these are familiar stories,I shall just run through the list very quickly.The upper left panel highlights the fact that though we have the wealthincome ratio declining, the lags in the effects on spending lead us toexpect that consumer outlays will continue to grow faster than income fora while longer, pushing the saving rate still lower. But spending growthdoes moderate.In the housing market--depicted at the right--we expect that withmortgage rates remaining near current levels, the monthly payment burdenof home-ownership will remain attractively low. This should keephousing demand from falling sharply as income and wealth growthweaken.In the business sector, the slowing of output growth, depicted in themiddle left panel, will turn the accelerator effects on capital spendingnegative. But that should be partly offset by the favorable effect of acontinuing decline in the relative price of equipment--charted at the right.Inventory investment, the red line in the bottom left panel, is expectedto move pretty closely with final sales. Not much of a story there.And, finally, government purchases are projected to run a little strongeron balance over the next two years. In the state and local sector, surplusesare growing to the point where we would expect to see some greaterexpenditure on infrastructure. In the federal sector, real purchases areexpected to come closer to bottoming out, with some obvious upside risksin defense and other outlay categories. The pickup in governmentspending, however, is only a modest offset to the slackening in the growthof private demand that we foresee.Lew will now shift the focus from the domestic side to the externalsector.\n","1999-02-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  SPEAKER(?).

HOENIG.Mr. Chairman, understanding the difficulties of thesean unwinding of the actions that we took in the midst of the crisis last fall. Last summerwe were continuing to experience strong growth in economic activity and jobs. We tooksome easing actions because of the Asian crisis. We introduced additional stimulus intothis economy, which is playing out now. I think we could legitimately and forthrightlyexplain a tightening move as an unwinding of those earlier actions; that would make itmore acceptable. In the long term such an action would be healthy.Having said that, I would make the directive symmetric if the Committeeadopts a no-change policy, as it appears it might, because we probably will not act duringthe intermeeting period and I don’t think we should suggest otherwise. So my preferenceis to unwind. However, if we don’t, I would not have an asymmetric directive.\n","1999-03-30 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.

FISHER.Little countries on the periphery of the exchange rate system ofour world economy can have active reserve managers. I don’t think it works for a major currency oreven a component of it in an NCB to have an aggressive reserve management program. For yourbenefit, we at the Federal Reserve--as I’m sure you pretty much take for granted--do not adjust thecurrency composition of our foreign currency reserves other than through official acts ofintervention. It’s routine for other central banks around the world to trade actively for profit in theexchange market and to hedge their reserve positions actively and dynamically. Malaysia comes tomind in its operations a number of years ago. When it’s a small country whose currency doesn’tplay a particularly dramatic role in the world economy, I think everyone knows how to deal withthat. When it’s a component of an institution that is one of the major central banks of the world, itreally is very different. The Bank of England, I want to be very clear, has a long tradition of beingan active foreign currency trader in the open markets. They’ve had some good and some badexperiences with that, and they’ve developed a century-long tradition that lends a note of distinction\f20to that kind of trading operation. I think that’s the exception that proves the rule rather than a goodpattern for others to follow.\n","2000-10-03 00:00:00\n","\n","not matched:  MR.
